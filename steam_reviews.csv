2023-05-06,"Posted: May 6, 2023 This isn't a game for 15$: Every match costs a piece of your sanity unitil you're left with nothing but regret, hate, rage and pain. Don't play this game. It will suck you in and devour you. There is no anti-cheat (in 90℅ games you will have rage/legit cheaters, unless of course you play on silver). There is no normal selection of players. There is no overwatch. No updates. The developers haven't cared about their game or the players for a long time. If you want to play, then play only on faceit (There you will be destroyed not by cheaters, but by guys with a ping of 1-5 and smurfs).",0,COUNTER STRIKE

2020-12-10,"Posted: December 10, 2020 After 8 years playing it, I didn't improve my skills in-game. However, I learned new language skills: now I can curse in Russian and Brazilian Portuguese. Also, my tolerance level to guttural screams and loud sounds was increased. Now I can bear the crying of my children for longer and I can make them feel better by singing sweet traditional songs from other cultures, such as Очи чёрные (Dark Eyes) or Garota de Ipanema (The Girl from Ipanema). In conclusion, Counter Strike transformed me into a better father and a better person, in addition to making me more patient, tolerant to hateful people and more trained in languages and cultures. Better than any psychiatric therapy. 10/10",1,COUNTER STRIKE

2024-07-12,"Posted: July 12 Fair Review that Explains the ""Mixed"" Reviews I have played over 100 hours and I will attempt to give a fair review that explains the state of the game with limited copium or trash talking. This is as of 7/12/2024. Pros: -The game is FREE and as of the current state, you can farm everything in the game without spending a dime other than skins -The grappling feature of the game provides a fresh take to the looter shooter genre and can create many different play styles. You can grapple onto walls to fly around, grapple to an enemy and melee for a free knock down effect, you can grapple onto a boss's armor pieces to tear it down, etc. -Variety of activities to do: different types of missions, ops, surviving waves of monsters, bossing (colossus), vault hunting, etc. -There are a total of 14 descendants (or playable characters) in the game albeit you gota farm for most of them. This game gives you 3 free characters through natural progression. Each character is quite unique and surely there will be someone who your preferred play style matches. With more characters coming on the way - Mod System : This is a great feature similar to ""traits"" or ""passives"" in other games. It provides different builds that fit your playstyle. You can easily spend hours strategizing what the best mods are, farming those mods, and using them for boss fights. -Boobas and peaches. Nuff said Cons: -The game is free as said above BUT if you do want to pay, it is extremely expensive compared to other games (its Nexon go figure) -Quality of Life: As this is a new game, it comes with flaws in QoL. For example, the ""Access Info"" section is really great for locating and planing what to farm and grind BUT they do not make that well known unless you are poking around each tab in the menu. -Story was meh at best and the voice actors were really not that great. It did change dramatically when I changed the voice to Korean (think of it as sub vs dub for anime). *Honorary mention fact (take it how you will): game has resemblances to Warframe and Destiny 2 Personal Opinion: -I have played over 100 hours in this game and usually I quit after storymode. Yes, I said the story is poopoo but that being said, it still made me play for a long time. Why is that? For me it is simple: Grappling. I see people mainly using grapple to run away or for mobility but you can use them offensively as well. Think of Attack on Titan with guns basically. You can grapple high up to avoid a mob then rain bullets on them from above. I would never get sick of that. Plus a free crowd control for grappling and meleeing an enemy? Priceless. -The game is free and as of right now nothing seems P2W. Yes, you can speed your progression by buying from the store such as the Ultimate Descendants that will probably take days if not weeks to farm. But is it necessary to have fun? Absolutely not. -I also want to debunk the drop rate complaints people are making. If you took middle school math, probability is a fixed number. Just because you tossed a coin with 50% chance of either side 10 times, does not mean you will get 5 of each side. You can technically still get 10 tails and no heads. ""This item is 20% drop rate and I ran it 50 times still didnt get it. The drop rates are rigged!"" is a common complaint i hear. Yes I felt this too but you gota remember probability does not guarantee a drop no matter how many runs since each run is its own individual probability dice roll. Final Verdict: -Despite obvious flaws in the game, I honestly think this game is worth a shot. I know I do this too but just because a game has ""Mixed"" reviews does not mean you will not enjoy it. Give it a try and make your opinion but I recommend this game based on my opinions shared above. Thanks for reading my TED Talk. If you made it here, I like pizza 🍕 Edit: formatting Edit 2: Just wana say thanks everyone. I never got awards on reviews before lol albeit I only left a few.",1,THE FIRST DESCENDANT
2024-07-04,"Posted: July 4 Product received for free If Warframe and Destiny 2 got waifu-ified and had a janky lovechild. Beware overpriced microtransactions. Verdict at the bottom. This looter-shooter has a lot of shocking similarities to both games, for example... Warframe-equivalent mechanics: - Upgrades/modding card system (mod slots, polarities, mod drain, forma, orokin reactors) - Upgrading mod cards and dissolving them for upgrade resources - Elemental and physical weaknesses - Mastery rank/weapon proficiency - Defense missions (down to similar UI) - Third person perspective - Character abilities and mana/energy - Level 30/40 character cap - Character switching and ultimate/prime counterparts - Relic/Anomalous loot system - Universal double jump and ripline/grappling hook - Simulacrum firing range - Long crafting times (dozens of real-life hours) and sub-parts to craft new characters Destiny-equivalent mechanics: - Exotic weapons with unique perks (the first one you get is literally just Riskrunner) - Power level/light level grind for gear specifically - Gear level infusion - Armor/modules and weapon loadouts - Weapon ammo types and ammo scarcity - Instanced dungeons/void intercepts - Open zone activities/patrols - Open zone fast travel - Nearly identical weapon archetypes (scout rifle, pulse rifle, hand cannon, sniper, shotgun, trace rifle, sidearm, etc.) The good ✅ - Borrowing mostly good mechanics from familiar games in the genre like Warframe and Destiny - Gunplay feels quite solid, almost Destiny tier (sound design is immaculate, visual feedback is solid) - The ability to lock and reroll substats (thank the lord, this should be industry standard) - Ultimate/prime character variants are technically obtainable for free (should also be industry standard) - Void intercept battles feel relatively original and are a great balance of challenge and fun The bad ❌ - Egregiously overpriced microtransactions - Inability to get most/any cosmetics without paying real money - General lack of polish (translation, grammatical, animation, performance, etc. issues) - Poor movement options when compared to Warframe - Relatively boring and uninspired story - Nexon, which has a history of having overpriced/predatory microtransactions and poor management Verdict 🏁 If you're familiar with Warframe or Destiny, or just want to dump some time into a decent looter shooter, you should give this a try. Just don't dump $100 on the Ultimate Bunny bundle... don't think I don't see you.",1,THE FIRST DESCENDANT
2024-07-02,"Posted: July 2 Warframe but made by nexon. The game is heavily monetized and handled by greedy publisher with shady practices. but its a good change of scenery if youre from warframe, its a free game, give it a try, but avoid ""investing"" in it",1,THE FIRST DESCENDANT
2024-06-30,"Posted: June 30 Managed to test all the characters in beta and here is my take: Best starting hero to solo all the story missions: Ajax (Tanker with good DPS) Best starting hero to transition into void realm boss fight: Viessa (ice cc skills can slow down the boss so teammates can focus fire on weak points easier) Most OP end game hero: Gley (High hp, high def, high dps, unlimited ammo). Pair it with a skill extension and -30 defense down pistol and have Sharen as a teammate to reduce enemies defense and you can pretty much melt everything. Cons: Boring skills. 2nd best end game hero: Sharen. Good fun skills. Equip the battlesuit melting nuts module to debuff bosses or any enemy defense (-50% if I'm not wrong) with her 3rd skill and use beam rifle with battlesuit crusher module to minus enemy defense by 50%. Best support and laid-back playing: Jayber. Set up your turrets and watch as all enemies die without you doing anything. Best if you have the attack turret module that makes you able to spawn 2x attack turret. All enemies will die as soon as they spawn (tested at the last map defense mission) Edit: Thank you for all the awards and thumbs up. Really appreciate it. I would like to add on that most characters are fun to play but some character are much better in end game boss fight where it really matters. For example, Bunny is extremely fun to play and you just erase enemies by just running around. However, she is a not the best to have in your party for very tough boss fights. But hey play what is fun for you. I'm the type that rather play the meta. All these test were done in Beta so you can take it with grain of salt as I do not know if there was any buff or nerf done to the characters but the logic is there. All the best Descendants! 2nd Edit: Hi guys, thanks for all the positive feedbacks and so many of the awards especially ""take my points"" awards. Wow. Truly appreciated! Now I can by more themes :) Yes this review was from Beta as clearly stated. After 60 hours of playing the actual game, I would like to update that indeed Gley is still OP! Check it out on youtube immortal Gley or Infinite ammo Gley. Actually, alot of characters are good for bosses too like Freyna, Viessa, Enzo etc. All characters should have no issue with the bosses as long as you invest in def and hp mods. So I recommend that you play what you like. It's gonna be a long grind with all these crystals that you have to get to polarize all your slot modules if you really want to make your character op in hard mode. Otherwise it doesn't really matter. I have a buddy who finished the story without using his 500k kuiper credits because he didn't know what to invest on. He got a good scolding from me alright 😂 So moral of the story have fun and if you want the most accurate current tier list, I suggest you check the list from youtuber named Moxsy. That's the best one I've seen. And yes Bunny is the best for farming. I use Gley as my main and Bunny for farming. Take care and have a good one! 😊",1,THE FIRST DESCENDANT

2024-07-23,"Posted: July 23 Mixed Reviews, You Know Why, RIGHT ??? Here is a short summary. By this I mean the whole text btw, - please open the review itself for better text alignment - 1.Nexons TFD EULA. -> Stealing Personal Data <- 2.Unknown software within TFDs gamefiles. -> ""BlackCipher64.aes"" does not behave normal <- 3.1 TFDs casino gameplay loop. -> items availability via percentages (drop chances) <- 3.2 Nexons Lawsuit. -> Nexon fined by the ""Korean Fair Trade Commission"" for ""deceptive loot box practices"", (faking the drop chance of certain items in their game ""MapleStory"") <- 4.Nexons priority is making money. -> Caliber currency and caliber in-game shop etc. <- 5.Actual -> Game Content <- review. 1. EULA was written by crazy people who don't care about your privacy and your personal data. Your personal data is most likely going to be selled to a long list of thirdparties. ""yay"" In case of a data breach, Nexon and thirparties are not the one at fault for losing all your personal data to some random people, who want to sell yours on the Black Market. Why? Because you silly human agreed to their EULA, just like meeeee. ""thumbs up"" lol To put it in a nutshell, Nexons TFD EULA calls for Stealing Personal Data, they do not care about you and do what they want. 2. Besides the kernel-level anticheat ""EasyAntiCheat"", TFD comes also with some unknown inhouse software delivered, called ""BlackCipher64.aes"" (file name). We have only a few assumptions what this software does, which are the following: - Another anticheat which just works like any other anticheat, ""doing cool stuff you know"". (Monitoring your whole pc) - Ransomware which tries to access folders and files within the kernel level layer of your pc and-or other folders and files ,and tries to execute specific actions on these. Actions like to encrypt, tamper, modify, copy, delete or to (steal) them, etc. If you had read Nexons EULA, you would have known by now, that Nexon most likely even does this. What it also does: - ""BlackCipher64"" files are in connection with files which has names like ""NGClient64 and ""BlackCall64"" in them. Both of them are also under the name of Nexon and all of them work probably as one whole thing. I'm not 100% sure about this part tho. There is a lot of evidence for both of those assumptions, so much at least that they could be confirmed as truthful. The reason for why I'm even mentioning this, is because a lot of people have reported unauthorized actions from software within Nexons game files like ""BlackCipher64.aes"". The problem here is that we don't know what this is for, and what it does. Not to mention that Nexons TFD EULA is ridiculous. Nexon has No Right to say that we can trust them, simply because we can not trust them when they put unknown software in their games which does not behave normal and they have an EULA which calls for Stealing Personal Data. 3.1 The drop chance of certain items are incredible low which makes the game even more luck based and grindier. The most items you'll need in the game have a drop chance of 20% or lower. Items which are considered as extremely rare are at 10% or lower. The rest is 32% (the items nobody needs of course). Not to mention that you have to stack this up with another extra (20%) drop chance for the Amorphus Material itself which you need, even in the first place in order to be able to get the item. Many people clearly don't like these drop rates. 3.2 The inquiry began back in 2021 where the ""Korean Fair Trade Commission"" looked into MapleStory from Nexon after they were required to publish the rate odds of their lootboxes in MapleStory. The KFTC alleges that between 2011 and 2021, Nexon covertly lowered the drop rates for certain high-value lootboxes. They also set some items = 0.00%. So that in the end you could not even get those items. Nexon was fined 11.6 Billion Won (approximately $8.9 million). However this fine is extremely small compared to the amount of profit they made between 2011 and 2021, 550 billion won ($418 million). And we don't know if they pull the same move on us with their videogame ""The First Descendant"". 4. The currency ""Caliber"" which you can buy for real money is fixed at 60%-95% of the price of an item which you can buy in the shop. Example: The Descendant Gley costs ""600 Caliber"", for ""$9.99"" you'll get ""520 Caliber"" Nexon makes it crystal clear that they want to milk money out of us, the whole game structure is about making money. 5. -Game content review here- Movement is awesome. Combat is pretty good. Graphics are good enough if you don't change your graphic settings below mid-high. Characters are made done pretty well. Good looking women and men, everyone wants that. Performance is not good, the performance sucks (with graphic cards below the high-end standard). The only bad content which you get slapped in your face with, is the story, worst story I've ever seen. After you've finished the story and you do some stuff in the second difficulty, it's getting kinda boring to be honest. Had a lot of fun with my 100+ hours on this game, but I think now it's time to rest. -> 7/10 overall <- Now for my last words. Why am I giving this game a negative review? It's kinda obvious. I really like the game, but.. ..there is one thing which ruins it. And this one thing is ""NEXON""",0,THE FIRST DESCENDANT
2024-07-11,"Posted: July 11 This game was really fun but the Terms of Service (TOS) is something to be reviewed closely and also the reason I'm not recommending this game.

2024-07-05,"Posted: July 5 Product received for free In the beta test you could craft paints for free to add a flavour of unique to your character, Nexon decided to remove this in the official game. Instead now you are charged 25 of the in game paid currency the smallest bundle costs around £4 to get 250. That in itself doesn't seem too pricey until you notice that you don't get to keep that paint despite paying for it. Say for example you want to paint a torso piece and it has say 5 slots you can customise. You'll need to buy x5 paints even if its the same colour JUST to paint it fully. If you purchased the 250 in game currency bundle you'd immediately spend 125 of it right away, on paint. People may say stuff like ''It's a free game they need money'' my friend, wait until you see the costs of skins in the shop oh and did I mention you CANNOT customise with paint the base game appearance for your character it literally forces you to pay for a skin and then forces you to pay if you want to paint it. Imagine if you apply the wrong one by mistake. Yikes. It gives you the option to buy every single item to void farming for it which is basically the core aspect of the game that's on top of being able to rush crafting instead of waiting but even then why bother going through all that when you can buy characters fully made and ready to use? Haven't even gotten to the best part here you can pay for extra upgrades to your character, at this current time I don't actually know if it's even possible for free to use players to get that chance but, I wouldn't be shocked if they can't considering the track history of taking down games nexon has after getting your money. Other points to note that isn't money motivated is that you can actually get in the way of people during combat. Body blocking is SO FUN when you're trying to use a range ability isn't nexon? Not even the option to crouch down in this game and let people engage in combat while you duck down out the way. I have a modern pc and graphics card I checked the requirements for the game before downloading it and I can more than handle the game and yet what's this ? Stuttering sure okay not frequent but the fact it happens at all? It's a cop out to say it's because of the servers nexon has had plenty of time to prepare for it and after the full 10 hours or more that the game went down for and it still happens? Check the terms of service did you notice what they want access to? It's more than suspicious don't you think considering the amount of encouragement you get to buy stuff. During the beta test alot of the community complained about the character Bunny wanting her to be one of the easier characters to obtain earlier on. She has quickly became the poster girl for the game that in itself is perfectly fine until you play the game. She is easily the most brokenly overpowered character currently in the game which is why so many users are mainly using her. You may wonder now is there even any good points to the game that can be noted? The only thing I truly have to say in the light of positive is that the cut scenes are very pretty to watch but that's it. My overall opinion is to avoid the game for now, If you still want to play it that's entirely your choice but if you do don't buy anything for a couple of months, what's the point in paying for stuff if the game gets taken offline after a short period of time? The more the community fuels nexons greed the worse it's be this is not how gamers should be treated. If you want a game that's free and does justice to both free and paid members go and play Warframe.",0,THE FIRST DESCENDANT

2023-07-22,"Posted: July 22, 2023 An amazing game that takes some time to learn. Start with AI lobbies so you can better understand the core gameplay. the 1.0 release has added a lot of QoL features for newer players, and made the game more fun to play. Also make sure you enable voice chat it is off by default for some reason... If you want to know what items to build on a character, or what skills you should level go to dak.gg. most of the stuff on there is very helpful. On the removal of the solo game mode: 90% of the current negative reviews are because they removed the solo game mode. A lot of people will tell you that they removed solos because of their investors, but what they won't tell you is that before 1.0 you could only find games consistently from around 8-12pm est in team modes and every other time of the day the game was nearly dead... Even solos had times of the day where you couldn't play at all. Them funneling everyone into 1 mode has successfully made the game playable at all times of the day. Not to mention the balance of the game has always suffered from multiple modes. If the playerbase grows it's likely they will add solos back, but people insist on crying on here, increasing the chances of new players not trying it out. Many will see ""mixed"" for recent reviews and assume the game is bad, but it's really just the old players being unable to cope. I played solos myself as well, for all it's problems it had its charm. I'm not saying it is good that it was removed. They made this decision to save the game, as it's clear they were not making money and could not sustain the game in its current form. The game is the most fun right now that it has ever been, you just need to find some people to play with.",1,ETERNAL RETURN

My friends and I have submitted tickets in with suggestions and they actually listened to our ideas and have changed some things like adding paper and changing some gameplay issues. This is such a great thing for a beta game as they change to the audience. Gameplay / Difficulty The game can be hard to get into definitely which might steer you away from the game but put some time into it and you'll find yourself having fun. If you're a micro / macro fan then this game has a lot of that, you can have multiple builds for a character that you choose from and you path in game to get items for your build. There's tons of items and path choices you can choose from that you can experiment and try new builds. Also in game, there's things such as consoles, bushes, all that so positioning is important. There's also tons of tiny things like food, animal drops and timers, Wickeline, traps, switching gear, mastery exp. As of right now, they are currently releasing new characters every 2 weeks or so, so you'll always have some new variety to play with and experiment with. Currently in NA, the ranked queue takes years to find games unless there's an event going on for it. Tips & Tricks ❖ When playing squads, try and find routes that line up with your teammates by zone 3 atleast. ❖ In any mode, find plans that get your weapon by zone 2, zone 3 is acceptable. ❖ Find some food that aligns with your path (like alley you can make hot ramen / garlic ramen) ❖ Don't try and fight early unless you have your weapon and they don't or you have an item advantage. Fighting early isn't always bad but it wastes so much time in getting efficient routes ❖ Improve routes (find items that are similar in your path so you can move to the next area, some areas are nearby that might have the same items so if you don't find your item, you can go there and get it) Great with Friends The game can be really annoying and frustrating especially in solos. Griefers, more people that kill you, paths and items being taken in your path, etc. In Squads and Duos, there's some leeways like being knocked down,  having 1 or 2 more teammates to revive you, teammates can get items for you, more safety, just everything feels better. I've had so many times where some areas are looted dry and other areas around it are dry as well and it feels so bad. But by being in duos or squads, you can have the safety of your teammates especially if you align your paths. you can most likely kill anyone to get their items. Personal Review / Opinion The game doesn't get ""too boring doing the same routes, over and over again."" Adaptability in knowing where items are found in other zones is a huge part of counterplay in this game. To me, this game feels like a real-time card game where you ""deckbuild"" your route with efficient pathing then when in-game you execute your deck, playing around and knowing your opponents' (meta) routes (or decks). To me, thinking,""Oh, my build fails mid-game because it 4-item spikes in zone 4. I should adjust my starting position,"" is the same feeling as thinking, ""My deck fails mid-game because my mana curve is too stacked in the 5 mana area making my early curve suffer. I think I'll adjust it after this match."" People will not want to invest the time in learning a new character due to the same routes. There's such a thing as mastery and the drive to improve or min/max. While I believe this game is not casual-friendly, the game strives in having a high mastery cap for a single character. I can play a character for a hundred games straight and still think to myself after the game that I could improve some parts of my route or my build. Just my two cents. This game challenges your item management and mastery of your limited inventory slots, this in term is like a ""deck size."" Do you want to pick up more lighters in your area for food later on, or does your build take too many components early. Maybe you'll grab that component in the next zone so you can make a bunch of surveillance cameras here. It's a series of affordances you constantly have to play around with. The game's balanced around item power in relation to route efficiency. Maybe your build is super greedy and spikes at the third route with four or five gemstones. You should adjust the build to take less contested items or know alternative routes.",1,ETERNAL RETURN
2020-12-27,"Posted: December 27, 2020 Early Access Review This game has broken my HARD moba addiction. I used to play league of legends, smite, heroes of the storm, dota 2, all the mobas you could ever imagine every day, for countless hours, constantly hating myself after every win. I was dissatisfied no matter the outcome. With wins, I was carried by teammates, with losses, I was held back by teammates. I was angry. But now, with this game, I'm happier then I've ever been. There's solos, duos, trios, customization, a fun mastery system that keeps you engaged throughout the entire game. Very fun game. Love it.",1,ETERNAL RETURN

2022-01-03,"Posted: January 3, 2022 Early Access Review I really want to love this game. I play it everyday and will continue to do so for a bit, but the strain it puts you through requires some kind of masochistic tendencies, which apparently I possess. The core gameplay and the mechanics are extremely enjoyable. The game runs well. It is generous in its distribution of currency so you can gain access to the characters that you want to play. It has a practice mode where you can play and try whoever you want before purchasing. The cosmetics, the map, the events are all incredibly generous for a Free To Play game. The characters and the balance of the game is actually pretty good, and the top characters generally switch out almost on a daily basis due to how well you can play. Although there are certainly some characters that are stronger than others. The core and foundation of Eternal Return are so freaking good for a smaller company. However, the biggest and most disappointing thing about this game, and why I, despite really enjoying it, am not recommending it is due to its absolutely awful matchmaking. I am simply trying to learn and get better, but often times the lobby I am put in has, quite literally, the best players in my region that proceed to, as expected, annihilate the entire game. Often times, the response to this would be, ""But you're learning how to play better"" or ""Get good"" or whatever. I'm no stranger to failure having played the Dark Souls/Bloodborne series nor am I new to the MOBA genre having played way too much League, Dota2 and HoTS. Now, the frustration and quite frankly, disheartening learning curve would not be so bad if the population of the game was anywhere viable, but it is not. And due to no/poor marketing, the que times for a normal game take about 5 - 20+ minutes. Hell, even 30+ minute ques are often the case. You can see why then the lobby you finally get into, would be frustrating, as you sit and wait for about 15 minutes, only to play for about 4 minutes because you encounter, literally the 7th best player in NA right now or something along those lines. This process happens. A lot. To the point that this is often the norm, not the outlier. Like I said, this learning curve wouldn't be as frustrating if I wasn't waiting for extended periods just to die. It's not fun for most people. And it's killing the game. Because if you don't float, you sink. And people would rather leave and go play something more enjoyable than sink. There is no ""Matchmaking"" system put into place for the normal game modes. There is however, matchmaking for ranked, but ranked is only active during very specific times, and if you are at work, at school or can't make it that time, well, you're out of luck because then you will sit in the ranked que, for literally 3+ HOURS without finding a fair Ranked game. So if you want to play, tough luck, you have to go into normals where you have a very high chance of encountering 1 - 3+ players in the region who will, let's be honest, curbstomp you because it is more akin to playing against bots due to how new some people are. This is the state of the current game. It is entirely disappointing because what keeps me playing is how much I absolutely enjoy its core foundations and gameplay. The GAME in itself, is very very good. It is gorgeous, it is interesting, fun to understand and plan out builds. When you get a fair lobby and the matchmaking WORKS, it feels like you're playing the game. It feels like you learn, even if you place very low because you understood what you did wrong. All of that is incredible and Eternal Return knocks it out of the park. But unfortunately, that is just not the case 90% of the time. You will get killed in 3 minutes, after waiting 15 minutes for a game, without understanding what's going on or what you did wrong, simply because the person that killed you is just, so much better than you, that you have no idea what you did wrong or how you could improve. It's like matching a professional Chess Player, like Magnus Carlson, one of the best players in the world to someone who's only played one or two games and then asking the new player, ""Are you having fun? Are you learning? See how you could improve?"" Except Magnus Carlson would probably take the time to try and talk to you. Eternal Return just ♥♥♥♥♥ you and leaves you feeling ♥♥♥♥ about yourself. I guess I'm a masochist. Thanks Riot.",0,ETERNAL RETURN

2024-07-09,"Posted: July 9 I have a few hundred hours from the betas and the discord people know me as the person that has a lot of negative things to say about the game. Saying that... the game is pretty fun. If you arnt a rust player expecting rust... its great. Its kinda like the division, its kind of like rust with building and what not. Its got really cool looking monsters and progression feels fluid and fun, if you like survival/crafting/collecting/etc kind of games. Its not super hard core, they have to go by chinese game laws which means no forced pvp. PvP servers feel more engaging, at least they did in beta. Accessing more of the map now may yield different results. The big negatives you see are from people not reading before doing anything. They created a character on any random server, they miffed their character creation just to rush in... and then realized they couldnt have a character on another server, when they likely had a friend do the same thing and didnt coordinate with each other first. It will be a while before we can make new characters. IDK why, i think its dumb... but its not worth review bombing over. There are other reasons that i would think might be logical to write negative reviews, but idk if they fixed a lot of that from beta. Dont let the mostly negative get you down. Its not pay to win, its cosmetic only. Its got some bugs, but its not terrible. I feels good to play. Check it out, try it for yourself. Its free...",1,ONCE HUMAN
2024-07-30,"Posted: July 30 If you scroll after serious reviews, this is another one of those. Recommended: I would recommend this game for people who want to enjoy a journey, not a sweat-fest because there's not enough content for it yet. The race for season 6 does not exist, there's just a continuous multi-season exploration. This is why: -Max level is 50 (you can reach it in 3 weeks out of the 6 total before the game reverts back to stage one while keeping everything important that you farmed for in the first run, if you play casually and if you spend at least 8 hours every day playing it) -Tech tree is relatively cheap because every week there are challenges and commissions which boost you. This means if you have knowledge of the game, you can reach the high-end tech in less than a week or two (I'm side-eyeing the crafting-gear tabs). - Grinding is super easy. You start with a multipurpose axe, followed immediately by electric tools that immediately cut everything giving you the full yield in the 0.5 seconds it takes to gather. (for referrence 1k of one type of resource will last for 2-3 days (1 or less in the case of tungsten or aluminium), and you can make 1k of each resource with the electric tools in less than 20 minutes). - It is easy to farm. If you think of dungeons (monoliths) and mini-bosses (silos) and extra-mini bosses (elite units)...they are semi-balanced, and guarantee what it says they drop in at least 6 runs. And if you want the best gun parts like optics or magazine...they are one simple puzzle away that takes maybe 5 minutes to get there and 1 minute to do what is necessary. Puzzles are unique and fun, sometimes as simple as shooting balloons or posing for a picture. Now an intro to the game: You can shoot in 3rd person and in 1st person. Most enemies are slow and easy to take out until mid-late game. It is also both PVE and PVP based on preference. You can build a house anywhere, edit it personally or in edit mode and transport it fully built to any other desired location. Houses can be: nomadic (truck-van), base (fortress looking with guns), modern, basic or castle (yes you can build a mini castle). And where you settle...matters. Every area (3 main based on difficulty with a total of 6 regions) has resources based on the necessity of each difficulty. Some areas have petrol (black ground) that can produce oil for cars, jeeps, trucks and bikes (the only transportation so far) or running rivers, pollution or waterfalls for electricity. The most resourceful are usually occupied by tryhards while most beautiful and unusual by casuals. In terms of variety you have mountains, beaches, islands, mainland, desert, jungle, swamps and valleys. Are you a hoarder? Great, grab everything, dismantle, and be amazed at how you will always have everything you need. You have a tech tree to unlock different building necessities, gear, munitions, farming, weapon tiers, electric panels and wires, tools and even the gatcha that people talk about.  The farming can be done in boxes or naturally on the ground in soil (that you also have to craft). It requires light, irrigation and fertilizer. This is pretty complex at first or it might seem intimidating but the further down the tech tree, the easier and better to care for crops is. Weapons and gear are of 2 types: obtained from drops and crafted. What's dropped you have to disassemble, what's crafted is what you invest in. The only thing worth investing in is the battlepass, as it isn't as reapy as the others, all you lose are cosmetics if you don't pay the monthly 10$ for each battlepass. Character customization is not as impactful because the fashion of the gear and mask cover most of the character. In terms of story-line, 99% is skipable but the environment tells more about the story and what happened than anything. There are familiars that you can own to farm for you resources or crops or animals while offline or online or even to use in combat. They can range from a bowl, to an onion bulb, a teddy bear, cats, baloon dogs, dolls, maidens, fairies, black holes, energy orbs, to secret agent looking bunnies who kill around for fun to get you food. Another major turn-off, aside from how horrible it is to build up-hill or down-hill, is the trade system. The price is up to you, there's no global market nor need to trade due to the early energy links from rewards and late crafting and farming that can get you to 240k Energy Links a week. The in-game currencies are starchrom (gatcha, buying blueprints and house cosmetics from shop), energy links (teleport, crafting, tech tree, upgrading), stelar planula (special shop stuff), cosmetic tokens (certain cosmetic shop stuff), crystigin (in-game real money for general shop purchase) and mitsuko marks (other special shop stuff). Trading is mostly with strangers (it can be done socially or introvertly through vending machines). Between friends, you can share everything and even in crafting, you don't need to sit with items in your inventory, everything that sits in your territory's chests, can be used from any position and bench and person that you allowed. The gatcha DOES NOT use real-life currency, it uses a rarer in-game currency. And if you do not like gatcha, you still have to / opt to build it for blueprint shop which can give you directly the blueprints for the legendary gear and weapons you desire. This is literally everything important that you need to know about the game before you try it. It's not perfect surely, IT STILL has many bugs from territory to bosses missing, But their team as I've seen is very dedicated, they give rewards each time they ♥♥♥♥ up, communication is great between them and the community and the players are super-friendly at least in my world (there's a world and server system). The rest I leave up to you to explore to decide if it's what you desire to play or not. For me, they did what million dollar companies never did and for a free to play game, it gives way more quality than others that I paid 60$ for.",1,ONCE HUMAN
2024-07-10,"Posted: July 10 A path I’ve never imagined: Supernatural & Survival This is a third-person survival game with elements of supernatural, and the online open world experience makes gameplay more interesting. At the beginning, you may feel it’s just like many other games with survival or crafting elements, but with the time you will realize those feelings are just superficial. This game has arranged it’s content perfectly to formed a closed loop, and polished better in some details. With those local elements, which I believe, will make you laugh. Subscribe NetEase UU Reviewer Training Project Subscribe UU game booster, you may have a chance to get premium for free Preface We tested the game before release and mainly played in PVE mode with keyboard & mouse, following content will be based on PVE mode. About “supernatural”, it’s definitions are variety, let me try to explain. Some folktales or myths with horror in present or future, and you can’t explain mysteries with science. Like, strange creatures or weird areas in those stories, those are “supernatural”. “Player- friendly” is a very good point If you ever experienced survival games, then you definitely could feel some hints from other survival games in this one. But it’s not simply borrowing or copying form others. This game has integrated those gameplay, and the best part is it’s reasonable experience which is a good solution to the complex operations and bad guidance in most of survival games. Facilities like craft table, the manufacturing info will be displayed above it. Function menu, building pages and craft interfaces work pretty smooth. Each time, a new function will be shortly noticed. Even you can’t remember everything, just find the “survival manual” in function menu. Although the up limit of your backpack is not much, but trust me, that backpack could load more than you could imagine, you don’t have to explore this world with worry. Materials respawn frequently, “collectors” will be satisfied with it. And in the camp, water consumption and hunger drop much slower which makes you focus on everything in camp. “Main quest guidance” and “build guidance” on left corner are divided but crossed. You will know your next gaol at the beginning, or if you don’t want follow the quest, just follow the survival guidance to build your own camp. But more or less this two lines crossed sometimes to lead you to explore this world. Content in “Building and Crafting” Notice: building construction and item crafting are totally different contents, but these two will be blended together. Levels of materials and equipment will not be introduced here, if you are familiar with survival game, you will fit in fast. If you are a rookie? don’t worry, you also will get it fast with good guidance. Survival experience and memetic system are related deeply, the latter is key to unlock building and crafting. Including collecting, to acquire materials. Craft, including weapons and medical supplies. Manage, relates food and power. Building, like house expansion and vehicles. Especially “building”. the building experience is pretty handy, you could get start easily and build your own comfy camp at the beginning. If you still feel difficult, the blueprints will help you to build your home piece by piece. Besides, there is a lot of content in building system. For a grinding gameplay, this game sorted many building elements, like structures, facilities, furniture and facade, multi sub options for each. It’s a large number! Like there are over 100 parts for buildings. Large number of content is not the main, diversities for house building are the core of fun in this game. Building experience in this game could meet most of the players, modular expansion is various and gets ride of most of physical simulation which means you could build your camp with imagination as you can. PS: DO NOT forget acquiring items manually in craft list when finish crafting in camp or on table. Explore supernatural Supernatural elements are not just background, they make the exploration different. Have to say some monsters designs are very impressed. Mixed some elements in modern city with human and animals, it’ s immersive. Like handcase man, Spotlight man, and crawling bus with weird hands. Those things scattered on map. The more strange it is, the harder will be encountered. Exploring at beginning lined by main quest. And devs provide side target in some area, a list with quest target and valuable items, to let you explore more area. It’s quite smart. Put target in a list and add some collections, so when you follow the quest, other things will be collected without noticing. You will be led to finish the whole list without awareness. Most things in the list are not must be done but some interesting side quests or awards to push you to have a look. Some may challenge, a chest may be above your head, but you should find a proper way to get there. Difficulty is reasonable, random enemies are not excited and harmful, but don’t take them lightly, sometimes you may fall if your ignore the danger. Boss and elite enemies are harder, but I promise they are not that hard to stop you. So explore the world without so much pressure and listening to the radio, you even could feel a little bit of cozy in this postapocalypse world. I recon radios in this game could meet most of you guys. Rock, Rap, Slow Roll, ACG, Classic, Country. My favorite is 107.2, quite nice! Game Experience Handy design, easy to learn, large number of building, unique supernatural exploration have deeply impressed me. And equipment system with growth is a important part of fighting. Although I have a lot of materials, but I prefer to use machete. There are some local joke in this game, like the boiled water(it’s even a important resources), and frozen fish as a melee weapon. It’s quiet interesting for me though. It is a survival game with supernatural theme. But mainly a third-person game, still, devs carved details and add some “small fun” in it. Thank you for reading my review!",1,ONCE HUMAN
2024-07-19,"Posted: July 19 This is honestly a really fun game. But they limit the number of total characters that can be made on a server instead of limiting how many players can be on the server at once. This creates a huge problem long term. Not only does it mean you can NEVER join your friend's server if it hit it's character limit. It also means if anyone quits, like the tons of people who check out a F2P game then bail after a couple weeks, they all continue to count towards the server character limit for every server they made a character on (up to 10). Those servers will still be considered ""full"" even if they only have 3 active players who don't even share the same playtime. Eventually all current servers will be dead servers that are filled with people who no longer play or who switched to other servers. New servers will need to be made for the influx of new players and you'll have to keep switching to those servers if you want an active server. But once you've made characters on 10 severs you'll never be able to join another server again. And those 10 servers will all eventually be dead servers. This will especially be a huge problem in a couple of weeks as the gaming tourists, who are trying a game cause it's free and new, eventually wander off and leave a slew of dead servers on their way out. I really, really like this game and think it has huge potential. But until this issue changes I can't recommend the game unless you just want something short term.",0,ONCE HUMAN
2024-07-09,"Posted: July 9 As someone who's put nearly 200 hours across the betas and tests. There's a severe abundance of misinformation being spread about the game so let's hit all the main points quickly, shall we? - Within hours of launch, the team fixed the ability to create characters on other servers - The terms of service and privacy policy issue: one guy read it and everyone else is vomiting that information based on that person's findings. These terms are no different from the majority of other modern games you accept today. - The gacha ""Wish Machine"" is used to unlock blueprints of some powerful weapons and it is a gamble. THE ONLY TWO WAYS of receiving this currency is playing the game, and available in the FREE battle pass tiers. There's literally no way to exchange real money for this currency. You have to earn it. - Spyware/cryptominer claims is just baffling If you dislike the game because you don't find it fun, having performance issues, or connection problems. Then those are some valid reasons to dislike the game. ------------------------ A bit of an actual review of the game now The game is mindless fun. It's not a masterpiece by any means. The combat is slightly janky, and not very challenging. Base building has some slight jank to it. The enemies aren't very engaging most of the time. But damn the game is fun If you're looking for something you can turn your brain off to and not need to try very hard but you're looking for a sense of solid, consistent progression, you should give this game a try. One thing I will glorify the game for however. Is the ability to craft from storage containers in your base. When you enter any building menu (base build menu, furnace, weapon workbench, etc.) it will automatically pull resources from all storage crates you have in your territory. No more forgetting where you put those copper bars, or metal scrap. It's all accessible to you at any time. The game also does a really good job at drip feeding you enjoyable content. You play a little bit and get tired of running everywhere, hey here's a quest to unlock a motorcycle and fast travel. Getting tired of collecting wood for charcoal? Here's how to setup electricity and eliminate your need for charcoal for furnaces. You've been doing a lot of looting but want to spend a little more time in your base, here's a new system that you have to build defenses and waves of enemies try attacking your base for some nice rewards. Tired of collecting wood and ore and just want to shoot stuff? Here's how to unlock an auto logger and auto miner that will passively gather things for you while you're off exploring. This is one of those things that gives me hope for the future of this game. There's a lot of attention to detail and innovative stuff when it comes to core survival game systems that we've seen unchanged for so many years. The one criticism I've been seeing pop is the seasonal reset stuff. If that's a turn off for you that's totally fine, it's not for everyone. But people thinking it's the end of the world need to relax a little. Rust does this every month, and that game came out 10 years ago. But it still consistently remains in the top 10 most active players on Steam to this day. The devs have said for this game you'll keep your blueprints on reset, which is arguably way more time and effort to farm than chopping some trees and hitting some rocks to make the weapons/armor. On season resets your materials (wood, ores, etc.) will be moved to this thing called ""Eternaland"" which is basically a big private oasis you can invite friends that's separate from the main game. Personal player housing that won't reset. Personally I'm using this two month period as a trial run. How bad will I feel during next reset when stuff gets wiped. Will I still be motivated to play? We'll find out in two months. The combat isn't difficult, there can be some downtime, but damn the game is fun. It's free, just try it and decide for yourself. Stop reading reviews. If you like it, you like it. If you don't, you don't, and that's okay <3",1,ONCE HUMAN

2024-07-12,"Posted: July 12 All the reviews complaining about TOS either can't read or are copy pasting takes from people who can't read. Game has nearly every single quality of life enhancement I can think of. Long range looting so you don't have to be super precise with your scavenging of POI's, creative flight with base building, crafting from base storage, automated gathering, inventory sorting and auto stacking, almost 0 food/hunger drain at your base. The game incentivises you to completely loot POI's by giving you a list of all the important boxes and checks them off as you loot them, as well as giving you a reward for 100%ing them. The bosses are engaging, the combat/gunplay has a lot of weight and everything from melee to archery to gunplay feels good to do. Some people dont like the seasonal wiping, but you dont lose anything important from the wipes. All important currency and blueprints and whatnot you keep regardless. But one of the most important things about the seasons to me is that they ensure that the majority of people are playing the same content. What happens in most MMO's is that a large amount of content is released and then people blitz to  the very end, so theres very few people playing any of the content before it. But with the seasons, they are trickling more content in on a week by week basis, so the playerbase isnt being immediately divided by no  lifers; which is extremely common in survival games and MMO's. I have not played pvp, but this game is without a doubt one of the best PVE survival games on the market, and it absolutely does not deserve the amount of negative reviews it has.",1,ONCE HUMAN

2024-07-19,"Posted: July 19 Product received for free Early Access Review A wholesome isekai adventure starring a friendly albino (?!) platypus, a malteser channeling Bob Ross and a Mecha-Shrew.. Once in a while I stumble upon a game that is just pure joy playing through, and following a cute platypus on a larger than life adventure was weirdly soothing at a spiritual level. At its core this is a modern take on the classic adventure games of old with treasure hunting, dungeon crawling and clever puzzles. However, it has also expanded upon that well known recipe with a museum collection side hustle as well as a plethora of minigames such as fishing, pottery, cooking and more! From breezy rhythm based cooking minigames and quirky pipe-puzzles to nail bitingly hard boss fights sprung from the depths of Dark Souls. All in all this combination of exploration and sidequests really breathed life into the secret world and made me truly feel like a stranger in a strange land.. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3292093689 The graphics are gorgeous with a really childlike aesthetic to it that I personally love, but acknowledge might be an acquired taste. Personally I really like the cartoony take on a land populated by anthropomorphic animals living out their lives in the very precise biomes of desertland, oceanland, jungleland and so forth. The world was truly open and not counting a few upgrades you get at different locations you are more or less free to explore any of the open lands after a short tutorial. This led me slightly astray in the beginning, lacking an upgrade that made it possible for me to get past a specific obstacle, but it never stopped me from trudging on my different path. Besides the main quest of finding the missing shards you get a fair deal of sidequests ranging from gathering ingredients to competing chefs to finding lost christmas ornaments. One of the rewards and something I really liked, at least as a concept, was that some of the side characters ended up as friends that you could call to clear paths and provide information. Even if it just acts as a one slight touch of characterisation in the early access version of the game I really liked the thought of calling a friend for clues when you needed to get pointers to find rare fish or secret family recipes. One thing that might be a fair warning is that this game ranges from fairly breezy (catching butterflies in the forest) to outright hardcore (battling ginormous bosses with only a slow dodge roll as a defensive measure). Two of the bosses I just gave up on and activated the “god mode” that makes Ogu unable to drop below 1 heart, an option that really should be added to every single game for the sake of inclusion. So on a difficulty scale this is pretty much all over the chart, but at the same time it does not punish you for wanting to skip an extra hard boss battle, something that makes the game suitable for younger children as well! https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3292088010 In the end I truly enjoyed my time with the game and despite it being in early access it felt extremely polished. In today's weird world where most games are released more or less in shambles this is a breath of fresh air. The openness of the game as well as its welcoming atmosphere really pulled me in and made the stories encountered on my adventures so much more memorable. Ogu and the Secret Forest really evoke a cozy feeling with its wholesome theme, gorgeous characters and captivating chill gameplay and I can't wait to finally get to see the finished version when it is released in a few weeks. I played 8 hours on a Steam Deck without any problems what so ever, so highly recommended for the deck as well. Ogu and the Secret Forest is a solid recommendation to anyone into the cozy side of adventuring and likes a game that really packs extra all. Some might call it gameplay bloat..

2023-03-24,"Posted: March 24, 2023 Early Access Review Positive and bright atmosphere, cute characters, appropriate puzzle difficulty (at least for me), boss battles with familiar yet new gimmicks for gamers, and small, charming side quests. I haven't played it for very long, but at this price range, it offers quite a rich content, which made the play enjoyable. Looking at the store screenshots, it seems like there are many puzzles and bosses I haven't experienced yet (even room decoration!).

And in the most positive way :D I had the most incredible surprise when I realized that this game totally feels like an old school Zelda! It's fun, it has puzzles, and it has its challenges! Totally what I wasn't expecting, seeing how cute and lovely and cuddly the game seems :o You fight monsters, you collect bugs and drawings and cute stuff, you solve puzzles, and you travel throughout the world map. Up until now, the difficulty level has been fun and not that difficult. However, at the time of this review, I am only in the 2nd area, so, I can't really tell how much the difficulty will increase after this point. So, want to have a lighthearted, cute, fun adventure?

2024-05-10,"Posted: May 10 The PC version of Snowbreak is actually good. Unlike my experience with the Phone version. Graphic and sound fidelity is top notch. A lot of tranparent elements, reflective elements. World objects are quite minimalist, but highly detailed. At worst, I'm getting 58 fps using Ryzen 7600, RTX3060Ti. And about 120 at highest, about 80 in average. I almost maxed out all the graphic setting, playing at 1440p. What kind of shooter this game is? The closest semblance would be Sword Art Online Fatal Bullet, and a little bit of Tom Clancy's Division. It is safe to assume, most of the time, it is a run and gun style. Division style with cover utilization is there, but the game would punish you since it will took much more time to finish. Several modes don't have time restriction, like the hard story mode. Enemies are bullet sponge just like SAO:FB or Division. Enemies has head part, or vital parts which if you shoot at them, getting increased damage or even outright kills them. Modular parts of weapon or armor. Which you can destroy to cripple their skills. The bullet damage font resembles SAO:FB. There are skills, ""magical"" skills like Genshin Impact. Some enemies design and the some of the stage designs looks like inspired by Arknights. There's stage sweep function just like Blue Archive. So you don't have to grind the stage over and over. Long story short, the game tries to incorporate a lot of good things from any related games out there. However, this can be seen as a double edged sword from another perspective. 1. If you know you can cover like Division, there's a good chance you'll lament the lack of the whole system or QoL from Divison. Like to move cover to cover, to switch shoulder when peeking in different direction, to hole the wall edge. Or maybe the AI, they don't have the same AI looking your latest position. 2. Inspirations can be seen as cheap to some people, more over if it just kit bash them there without elaborate effort, or without the core, unique style to define the game. Also if you're looking for cons, 1. The minimalist world design can be seen as a lazy world design. Also objects can be huge, like portals, or elevators. There's one elevator is huge enough to transport Gundam. 2. The hitbox and physics are quite inconsistent. Like sometimes i can shoot between obstacles just fine, sometimes but seldom, can't. Sometimes things flies like there's no gravity, like the gatling gun when it is destroyed. 3. Even SAO:FB has better multiplayer content than this game. 4. English VA sucks, it even will automatically switch to Japanese for some newer characters. I recommended to only use Japanese or Chinese. It is kinda sad, since i think the 4* Lyfe EN VA has quite cool lines. And actually I'm not quite fond with the JP VA either, IMHO quite subpar compared with JP VA on another gacha games. If i give them score on average, 6 out of 10. 5. Skill description is not organized well. It is hard to understand the character skill when facing a wall of text. I tried to read them several times, until i finally understand what they meant with it. My conclusion, is they're trying to be verbose with every little bit the skill can do, implications, and the damage formulation. However, it is much more organized when the game put a summary first, then details in something like a tab or a tooltip on names. Second worst after Memento Mori skill description. 6. Time restriction on missions should be not exists unless it is a specific time attack kind of mission, which also should be optional. I know the time given is quite ample and relaxed, but it kinda kills a certain playstyle, and i don't think it is popular choice. Technically it is not a time restriction, but rather you get more bonus if you can clear it faster. But i don't think it is what first comes in mind when the game tells you, if you're not doing enough. 2 stars out of 3, since you're slow. One biscuit off for you. Maybe Pro maybe Con, or maybe neutral, 1. Characters are quite sexualised. More obvious on newer ones, or skins. Depends on which spectrum you're, can be seen as pro or con. 2. Gun type is fixated on character. It is like if Lyfe tote an SMG, she would use only SMG for the rest of her lyfe. Means, if you happens to like a certain weapon to be paired with a certain character for the skill set, you can't do it. Or be like me, i like AR (assault rifle), but i only got a character for that until quite late to the story. And it is 4* Fritia. She is good for a 4*. The problem with that, I've already invested on another characters earlier, which may be not if i get her much earlier. SMG is probably the worst weapon in the game in general. 5* Cherno Enigma is kinda an exception. Cherno Enigma is a character name, happens to clump her together as SMG because the game does that. 3. MC is gender locked for the moment. And no to only minimal MC-character customization. What i don't know is story, i don't read them. The story events are quite elaborate, but i usually skip them. NPCs at the reading mode doesn't have voice, they has simple L2D, NPC graphics seems at lower resolution. My best bet is, the script is not easy to read in English. I'm not reading anything when playing. I read when it is the time to read. The elaborate I mentioned, is something i understand at the story while doing the mission. Like, after arrives at point A, there's radio explaining what happens. Then proceed to point B to continue. Some cinematics in between. Also switching character to see from another perspective. Although i don't understand or read the story content, how they weave the story into the stage is definitely a treat for me. Monetization. Honestly I'm not yet sure if the game is greedy or not for you. I'm a newbie joined at May 4th 2024, but I've cleared the newbie banner (50x), and pulled 145x at the Cherno Enigma banner completely F2P. May 10th 2024. So, for a starting, it is all generous enough. Not sure how it is after i cleaned the 'welcome gifts'. The gacha rate for character is 0.7%. You'll get a guarantee 5* at 80, then guaranteed banner unit at another 80 after that. The spark limit is rather low. But, there's weapon gacha. If you plan for the worst, 160 pulls. So, the game is just like Mihoyo games when it comes to gacha. Character banner and weapon banner. There are weapons on character banner. Skins are rather expensive IMO. Character dupes are important, especially at the 1st stage duplicate bonus, but you can farm them. Slowly, like 4 times or 4 pieces per day. Need like 30 shards to complete a duplicate stage. If you ever played Blue Archive, it is like raising the star or special weapon star level, by using eleph. And that one star is like one duplicate stage I've mentioned. If you read this far, It looks like a lot of CONs or dubious flags alright? And why I'm recommending this? Free, shooting game, casual, pretty, anime, quite reasonable for F2P to me. I'm familiar with similar gacha games. I'm looking for a casual shooting, I found one here. It have waifus, pretty graphics. And sounds mesmerizing on my audio system. Satisfying gun sound. No matter the cons, what I'm looking pretty is pretty. Also, so far it is enjoyable as F2P. I'm a person who won't spending on gacha games until i'm playing it long enough to ensure my anxiety about its future prospects. And the game has so far does facilitate the effort, and it is a good thing. Some other gacha games just outright ask you the money or ditch the game. It isn't like I don't recognize the cons, a lot of them. Just like Blue Archive, for farming purposes, the game doesn't tax me a lot effort. Sweep everything.",1,SNOW BREAK: FORBIDDEN ZONE

2023-12-29,"Posted: December 29, 2023 Hi there! I wanted to leave a positive review. Ignore my played time as I've been playing this game every day since the launch via their client (Account lvl 90 atm). Pros: - Good char design and aesthetic overall. - Unique (atm) gacha shooter gameplay where you enjoy your waifus and can shoot with a good enough shooting mechanic. - Good music and voice acting English and Japanese (I've tried only these and I don't plan check other ones). - Good devs approach in many aspects (see below). - No need to pull for char duplicates as you can farm them daily (slowly but still possible). - Weapons stars are just 2 (so only the first and second copy will max out your legendary weapon). - Good and various enough events. - No need to waste a lot of time for daily routine (which I highly appreciate in such type of games). Therefore, if you are short on time 2-5 mins are enough daily. Similar goes about weeklies just slightly more time. - I usually don't like the content as abyss in Genshin, HSR and so on but here you have the option to do it on easy difficulty and still get ALL crystals for pulls. - As mentioned above about daily routine, you use your energy and get mats with a skip button (if you prefer you can still do it manually). So if you don't like doing same stuff each day - you do not have to do it here (ref. example Genshin energy for arts' dungeons). - Rewarding donations: Subscribtion has more stuff to it now (extra char skins, chat emoji and, I think, more to come in the future). Bonuses for overall donated amount in this game with very nice skin for good char and more other stuff. The battlepass will be described below as a con. - Customer support does actually respond and try to help or inform you according to the reported issue. - Interesting weekly coop task (slightly similar to HSR mode where you choose different buffs through the run to create your ''unique'' build for that run). - Interesting weekly task to kill of 2x bosses that change every week where they have increasing difficulty per stage (the final one is optional and that's the one for you if you like challenge). - Very good and useful (the major part of them) standard 4 star and especially 5 star chars (DPS and support wise). - The content called ''Base'' where you interact with your chars to understand better their lore and attitude. You can also interact with them through a special gift with unique animations (not much but good enough for now). - Dialogs / scenes for each char affinity to understand better chars attitude and lore as mentioned above (at least there is such a thing). - Char ''Talents'': You can reassign them as you like with no costs if they are not maxed out yet. - There are standard skins but I wanted to mention as a pro unique skins (they cost more than the standard ones). They have much stuff to them besides the char model skin. - Maybe I've missed something else that you will find out yourself as a pro. Cons: Some of the cons could be explained by the game being fresh enough, but I'm still going to mention it (room for improvement in my opinion) - Lack of coop tasks / activities for my taste. - Maybe some additional and better shooting mechanics (if that's possible). - Lack of voice acting for the storyline scenes / dialogs (actually I don't like such storytelling at all). - Not the best and interesting story and overall lore but I would say I wouldn't complain much about the existing one. - More unique and various enemies (they are adding them but I still think there should be many more). - More unique weapon mods (some mechanics wise)? AKA silencers, barrels and so on. - Battlepass is Genshin alike for my taste (useless overall besides some interesting skins from time to time for the upgraded version). - More interesting / unique / new stuff and interactions with your chars in the content called ''Base''. - I hate 50/50 gacha mechanic (even if there is a 100% chance when you fail it, because I fail it very often...same as in Genshin but that's my individual luck and experience). As an example, I prefer more the Dislyte  gacha mechanic where you pull daily the standard banner where all chars are added (new ones as well after their run) and you gather with pulls a cashback that you can use to take with a 100% chance one of 3 chars that are in the current rerun (my own opinion / taste). - More content overall but I understand that this request requires me to be more patient. - Where is PVP? (maybe and, hopefully, they plan it). - Meh locations / gameplay instances (strong con). - Maybe something else that I've missed and you will find out yourself as a con. Sum: I would say give it a try if you like gacha games and shooters. I enjoy this game much because it doesn't require much of my time and still I don't lose on progression. Therefore, I can enjoy my waifus with low time requirement for the grind (pulls, gear and lvl wise). Ending: If you got here and found my review useful, please like it so there is more chance for other people to see it,",1,SNOW BREAK: FORBIDDEN ZONE

2024-03-30,"Posted: March 30 It's a gacha game that incorporates common elements like energy mechanics, free exclusive rewards, collecting waifus, catering to players' fear of missing out (FOMO). It offers single-player and multiplayer (co-op) modes focused primarily on PvE, with no PvP elements. The game boasts cross-platform compatibility, allowing seamless progression across PC and mobile devices. The PC Launcher and Steam versions are also synced, so you don't have to worry about losing your progression if you play it on the PC launcher before, just like me. The gameplay consists mainly of third-person shooter mechanics. Beside the main story, it comprising 80% permanent content and monthly limited-time events. Additionally, players can engage in casual activities like visual novels for story progression, mini-games, and interacting with their waifus. While movement feels smooth on PC, mobile users may experience difficulties. Graphically and visually, it's satisfactory. I'm not really nitpicking in terms of graphics, though the character models may appear lacking compared to the art style. I think it's due to performance optimization because surprisingly, the game runs smoothly even on lower-end hardware like a 6th-gen Core i3, 8GB RAM, and a 920 MX GPU, allowing me to play on medium-high settings. The game's theme music is commendable, avoiding repetitiveness. However, the lack of voice acting in the visual novel segments may deter some players. So, players may decide to be nerd or just skipping the story. It offers various challenging endgame activities like rogue-like modes and solo bosses. As a free-to-play player at level 84, I've yet to conquer all content, but my progress has been enjoyable overall. I don't think this game can be considered as pay-to-win because I could still beat challenging content despite progressing slowly. You can buy exclusive skins for your favorite waifus if you want to, although unfortunately, they can't be purchased with free in-game currency. But I won't complain about it. One major downside is the prevalence of bugs, particularly in co-op mode. Player freezing and delayed actions during fights are common issues, often attributed to poor internet connections. While tolerable, these bugs detract from the overall experience and warrant attention from the developer. Despite its flaws, Snowbreak earns a respectable 7/10 rating from me. While the bugs are frustrating, the unique blend of third-person shooter gameplay in a gacha game makes it worth experiencing.",1,SNOW BREAK: FORBIDDEN ZONE

2024-02-01,"Posted: February 1 Product received for free 6/10 In today's mobile gaming world, where the anime increasingly becomes the go-to theme, more and more developers seem eager to explore this relatively untapped ""blue ocean."" Snowbreak: Containment Zone is no exception. This game attempts to merge third-person shooting with the traditional anime-style gacha character development, offering a fresh take on the anime game industry that's largely devoid of FPS and TPS mechanics. However, it turns out to be a case of all that glitters is not gold. Whether it's the all-too-familiar yet uninspired core gameplay, clichéd and stereotypical character designs, bland and uninteresting storylines, or the highly repetitive and overly fragmented level design, it likely falls short of players' expectations. In terms of its world-building, this game skillfully blends post-apocalyptic wasteland aesthetics with a futuristic tech vibe. The fluid action design of many boss characters is visually impressive. Its squad-based, switchable combat system theoretically offers players a vast array of tactical options. However, the generally long skill cooldowns and limited stamina bars somewhat dampen the gameplay experience, creating a contradiction between being neither hardcore nor casual. Fortunately, the overall difficulty of the game is quite low, making it accessible even for players not well-versed in third-person shooters, as they're unlikely to encounter roadblocks beyond level-based challenges. The game also supports multiplayer PVE, featuring a wide variety of modes and an auto-sweep function, making it suitable for more laid-back, 'retirement' gaming sessions. Sadly, despite its strengths, the game's flaws are too significant to overlook. The plethora of game modes and levels in this game may seem to promise a rich gaming experience, but in reality, they are highly repetitive and lack creativity. The overly complex and tedious mechanics mean that while the game is easy to pick up, it requires a significant time investment to learn. The story is also deeply flawed: not only is there a lack of comprehensive voice acting, but the available voice work is stiff and unnatural. The narrative is disjointed and bizarre, lacking logical progression and build-up, and this issue persists even halfway through the main storyline. The writer's poor handling of the text fails to do justice to the game's expansive world, leaving the story far from impactful. The character design, supposedly a major selling point, is also extremely stereotypical, with superficial character development failing to leave a lasting impression. The Live 2D animations feel odd, and the characters' 3D movements and models often appear stiff and crude. The AI logic during combat is also woefully inadequate. Although the game's gacha system doesn't require a high number of pulls for a guaranteed drop, the low drop rates combined with the numerous types of resources and card pools significantly increase the cost and time investment for players, raising suspicions of it being a cash grab. Rather than considering Snowbreak: Containment Zone a finished product, it feels more like a game still in the Early Access stage, which would be more acceptable. The cheap UI, clichéd and overused storyline, mediocre shooting mechanics, and poor interactive experience are all major drawbacks. However, it must be acknowledged that it does pass muster in comparison to similar games, mainly because it's quite welcoming to new players with its low entry barriers and generous benefits. The overall difficulty is not high, and a decent gaming experience can be achieved with time investment. But this hardly compensates for the game's lack of depth and highly repetitive and uninteresting gameplay. Although the game enjoys a stable and large player base in its Chinese server, thanks to its unique theme, the Global server's player numbers are concerning. I would only recommend it to those looking for a long-term, casual anime-style gacha game with TPS elements, who don’t mind the poor storyline. Additionally, given the mediocre optimization on PC, I'm skeptical about the gaming experience on mobile devices. Find my reviews valuable? Click here to join my curator group.

2021-08-02,"Posted: August 2, 2021 Wassup KOG! Hear thy concerns of your cash-cows, I mean players. Concerns that if not fixed, will make you lose your player base. Here are some, enjoy! - They only updated the UI but with added bugs as if KOG is telling players that they just patched this game straight from the basement to get some cash. - Only 4 of the 20 characters at release. Why? So you use up your character slots, so when they release new characters you want, you will be forced to use VP to buy more character slots. - It's missing the tree-house feature at the moment even though again it's clearly based on Season 5. - There's also no dodge(evade) skill by using the Left-Alt Button, making the game phase much much slower and a lot harder in the process. - Not enough options to create weapons and armor at the forge. - Drop rates for equipment and materials are so low that it forces players to use low-level items. Why? So people will buy VP equipment only, the same idea with the forge. - Character skills have been nerfed. 3 bar skills now do very little damage and you can't buy MP potions with GP anymore to use lots of skills plus, dungeon pets don't really give MP anymore, only Gatcha ones I guess. Why? So you buy VP of course! 😉 - Job level requirements have been changed from 20, 30, and 40 to 20, 40, and 60. Why? So you buy VP missions. - Another classic marketing strategy, 1000 VP to reset 1 skill, but 1500 VP to reset the whole skill tree? Who is going to buy the 1000 VP one? Nice try KOG, nice try. - 3rd job and 4th job missions both have false requirements. For example, it says finish Partusay Champion mode 5 times, but it really doesn't need to be in CM, etc. - There is no shared inventory and shared gatcha pets. Even GC club is not shared across characters and the warehouse has very fewer slots than the original release. Why? EZ, so you'll buy more VP - Gacha isn't split into armor, accessory, and weapon anymore. It's all together. Why? So you don't have the option to choose what you want and have less luck getting the things you want. - Game's resolution is still 4:3. They didn't even try fixing it. It really is classic I guess¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (Good for your Windows XP!). - Laggy connection with laggy menus. - We used to get daily champion mode tickets and event dungeon tickets after every dungeon or just buy them with 100,000 GP or coins in the Heroic Shop. Now, the only way is thru 1000 attendance points (2 days) or, of course, through ""VP"". - At the first official re-release, players can only play up to Ascencion (Thanatos). It feels like an early access game although it's a game released a decade ago with only 4 starting characters with the plan to slowly release them as if it might get people excited about what's coming. (People already know the game and all the characters; they'll get annoyed or get bored if it takes too long). *These concerns can also be seen from a lot of reviews by other players who love the game and there are a lot more to be discussed, but I think I got my message across, KOG ripping people off harder this time than its first release.* Conclusion: Most players are only playing this because of nostalgia and it won't hold them for long. When nostalgia runs out people will realize how sad the current state of the game is. Most of all, people know when they're being ripped off, do yourself a favor, and learn from your past mistakes. KOG thought that people are coming back just because of how fun the game is because of dedicated players from the private servers, sadly, they don't get the point. People love the game due to private servers owners who also love the game themselves and are not out just to milk their cash cows. It's kinda sad that you're willing to shut them off, especially for those communities who really love the game and not just helping them at all coz you're only after peoples' money. They shut down this game once before and I'm sure if they aren't happy with the amount of revenue generated by the game they'll do it again. WP KOG, WP.

2021-08-01,"Posted: August 1, 2021 Don't let this nostalgia hit distract you of KoG's track record. And with that out of the way, a little piece of my mind before talking about the current standing of the game. I have played this since 2006 on the Brazilian servers and it was a blast back then, game constantly updating and it was a novelty back then- Up to the point of around 2010 the game had started to age poorly with higher tech and higher polish games appearing along the way, GrandChase really didn't make much of a success as in Brazil/South America- One of the main cash cows KoG had, they chose to cut costs and started to focus their development on Elsword. That game didn't catch as much attention as KoG wanted it to around here, our local publisher even offered to buy GrandChase's rights to keep offering service (and maybe even continue its development back then). With Elsword's slowly decreasing population, increasing dissatisfaction of the game's system and how KoG doesn't seem to care much about F2Ps around there- with KurtzPel flopping as hard as it could and having the same issues with F2P, it's safe to have an educated opinion on how this will just be a cash grab for those who are feeling nostalgic about this poorly aged nostalgic blast from the past that people used to play while in middle school and the only other contenders really were mostly other kind of games (MMORPGs like Perfect World, Ragnarok Online, etc) especially for the folks here in Brazil. This game is fun. It truly is, and it definitely was when I played it back then- The thing is: It has aged very, very poorly and KoG really, really does not have a good track record of listening to players and making changes that actually matter and aren't controversial. Don't get me wrong, there will always be people complaining about updates or lack thereof- But really, if they follow what they've been doing in Elsword.. As for the game standing, it has the same snapshot it had before the servers were closed- Polished for higher resolutions and minimal technical fixes, the game stands almost exactly the same as it was before. Very few things were touched/changed even from the Beta to the launch itself, a lot of the same old bugs are in the game (most of them are ""harmless"") while a few others are easily used to exploit fights whether in PvE or PvP. It seems to be that KoG is around trying to punish players who deliberately abuse of those (instead of fixing legacy code, which honestly is a daunting task to do without remaking the spaghetti that keeps this game together, literally ask anyone who has worked with legacy code. It's a slow and costly process and KoG would most likely not be inclined to do so) As I really like to explain this game to anyone who asks me about it: It was the live-service sandbox to test all of the systems that worked out or didn't work out for Elsword. You can easily see all of the separate character mechanics, separate inventories, starting to ask for money for extra character slots. Pets being locked for each character, the refining system itself, the 'new' rewards system and set bonuses that will get you a huge advantage, the drop system that was changed four times on the game's history as far as I can remember so you don't even have the GP (Gold Points?) armor and weapons in the store anymore, you need to grind the hell out of it and it isn't even guaranteed for your character with the current system! Of course you have the daily/hourly challenge to eventually buy Phoenix set but who's gonna do that after they're near level 85, and want to make sure to have a +10 weapon for PvP, right? The balancing in the game has always been and I believe will always be dubious at best, as the way the game was worked out is inheretly flawed. Systems such as the Beserk (Elesis counters to projectiles) or MP Beserk (Arme counters to projectiles) are just a way of saying ""hey I've tried making projectiles less unfair for others in PvP but it didn't work much haha sorry I don't wanna change how those characters work"". That would be a problem to keep as is and would be a problem to change them because people would complain, so KoG chose the former and not spend a single dime on actually balancing a bunch of stuff for PvP, really. There are only a few handful of characters that are actually playable (and coincidentally, the most popular ones! Jhin, Azim, Ryan on his 4th class, and anyone who has better input handling than someone that's god awful at it. One good example would be trying to do anything with Lire's first class compared to those mentioned) because of the very clunky and weird action system (hell, literally play Elsword for a couple hours and try playing GrandChase again- You will notice the huge difference), there are no input buffers and you *will* need to get the timing down of combos and cancels as best as you can. This could be used as ""ah, so you just need to get good, right?"" Well, yes, sort of. If you really know how to play, it will easily shine through but the chances of you being mistaken for those who are macroing is very, very high because of the tight inputs you really need to do to actually do something that isn't a 3-second animation lock. Ah, I have mentioned Lire and Arme a few times here and good luck trying to PvP with them. Their normal movement and combo kit is so piss poor that they resort to cheap skills most of times (Arme's MP1- Petrify is a good exemple) and culturally (South America/Brazil) you WILL be kicked out of the PvP lobby as soon as you switch to those characters. Not to mention the whole refining system all over again.. KoG really loves doing this and holy hell, good luck getting your weapons up to the refining grade you want because you will need either a lot of patience or a lot of money. PvE will eventually force you to most likely get some cash in to get extra revives if you're trying to solo content (whether that or getting some good ass gear on the rewards system plus the awesome looking pet) because I'll tell you, without the proper information on how your character works.. You will most likely be flattened down by enemies who have almost all times poorly-designed cheap tatics to kill you. One time favorite of KoG's is to spam super armor frames on almost all attacks, fill the room with those monsters and call it a day. Another one is big AoEs, anything that can stunlock you or CC you out or your mind. You better get that Mari LaGeas (4th class) going and a whole bag full of potions to clear some content if you're not geared enough for it. KoG has taken the approach of time-gating content (especially characters and the gacha/ice-burner/rewards system), which is an easy way to pad and proxy people to come back to their game as if it was a ""wow it's a launch of a new character! Meanwhile some people in the beta glitched and could create characters that weren't the first intended three, which is enough to say that they *do* have the characters in the game already, it's just really time-gated under their own 'roadmap', if it's even fair to call it that. And with that long and emotion filled rant about this launch, I feel it's again safe to say that we all just really wished for a GrandChase 2 (Elsword's combo system but better and all the old characters and story we love) but we got none of that. Just pretty much a private server that's being oficially hosted by the developer itself- Hell, even the private servers that were around had a lot better balancing and actual care put into the damn game. From here, there are a few outcomes: Game stays gets minimal development after the time gating, basically to be able to say ""it isn't in maintenance mode!"" Game stays in maintenance mode indefinitely after the time-gating stops, with KoG just cashing out on it and letting a few servers. And now for the more unlikely: Game actually starts seeing further development. Game gets remade, GrandChase2 is real and Elsword is dead. Edit: KoG plz Edit2: nerfcity.",0,GRANDCHASE

Nothing ""Classic"" about it, everything good changed and everything bad kept. There are only two game modes, armor cant be bought with game currency(GP), you cant quickswitch characters, turned off chat still pings, the menu is somehow worse than it was 10+ years ago, and so on. Yet, some of the worst parts of the game stayed for some reason. Limited PER CHARACTER inventory? When i now DEPEND on drops? Really? Guess i need a total of 20 slots for Ruby Dust alone on EVERY CHARACTER right? ♥♥♥♥ off. I can't just ignore the monetization problem too. Cash gear better than regular gear, ok. Cash cosmetic gear, ok. Paid revives, paid character slots, paid inventory, GACHA. No, just stop. Stop trying to wring out money from nostalgia. At least work for it and deliver a decent product. From what i played, i can't recommend the game AT ALL. You're more likely to be disappointed than relive happy times. The company DOES NOT CARE about you or the game.",0,GRANDCHASE
2021-07-29,"Posted: July 29, 2021 Edit: It's been 6 months, time to update the review. Good game that has been rereleased as a cash grab, very sad. Problems (VP = Premium currency): - Bad connection and laggy menus. - New ugly UI with text that doesn't fit in boxes, ugly fonts and misaligned boxes. - No way to buy GP weapons or armour. Why? So you buy VP armour. GP equipment shop is back in the game. - Not enough options to create weapons and armour at the forge. - Drop rates for equipment and materials are so low (you will probably be wearing some level 30 accessories at level 70). - Character skills have been nerfed, 3 bar skills do very little damage and you can't buy MP potions with GP anymore to use lots of skills. A lot of skills have been buffed, but still a few skills still suck. - All forms of dodging removed. Dodge scroll still missing but some characters have skill tree dodge. - Due to bad equipment, no MP potions, no dodge, awful skills, and bad monster balancing, the game is extremely hard late game. It's easier now, but still harder than it should be. - Only 4 of the 20 characters at release. Why? So you use up your character slots, so when they release new characters you want, you will be forced to use VP to buy more character slots. Well we are at character 12 now (Zero) and all have been free. - Job level requirements have been changed from 20, 30 and 40 to 20, 40 and 60. Why? So you buy VP missions. - Cash prices make no sense, 1000 VP to reset 1 skill, but 1500 VP to reset the whole skill tree? Who is going to buy the 1000 VP one? - 3rd job and 4th job missions both have the wrong requirements. For example, 2nd part of the 3rd job says complete The Crucible 2 times, but really the mission is to complete Kamikis Castle 5 times. Fixed - There is no shared inventory, even GC club is not shared across characters. If you get a gacha pet it can only be used on one character too. Why? So you buy more VP to get more inventory slots, warehouse slots, GC clubs, the same gacha etc. - Gacha isn't split into armour, accessory and weapon anymore. It's all together. Why? So you don't have the option to choose what you want, and have less luck getting the things you want. - Used to get daily champion mode tickets or buy them for 100,000 GP. Now the only way is 1000 attendance points (2 days) or VP. Get tickets every attendence check now. - Game still plays at 4:3 lol. Honestly I can go on and on but I think you get the point. Game is still fun, but it's a clear cash grab. Everything has been redesigned in a way to make you pay more money. Please don't spend. Overall one of the worst rereleases in history. The game is slowly getting better and taking shape, however there is still no doubt in my mind that it's just a cash grab. If you are interested in playing the game I would still recommend waiting a short while for all characters/content to be re-released but if you want to play now, it isn't too bad like it was at release.",0,GRANDCHASE

2021-07-30,"Posted: July 30, 2021 Oh boy where do we start... This game was incredibly nostalgic back in the day and it feels good to see it up again, while it holds a small spot in my heart ill hold off to nostalgia and try to talk about its problems. Expect a wall of text deetailing issues and what i (a veteran player) think of the current state of the game. The Good - -Minor changes to UI in certain parts of the game, like mission screen where new animated characters can be seen -Minor Bugfixes that fixed some old exploits that allowed players to farm easier around the world -Introduction of Minor ""Growth Quests"" that allow each character to gain few items and points as they play -Almost 20 servers currently open, Granted  Half of that is dedicated to S-America and rest is finely split between Asia and N-America -You can freely enter any server and keep your characters and items. Thats... honestly it. Its sad i know The Bad - Its longer then CVS Receipt but lets see if we can put it all together: -Half the games UI is unfinished and extremely convoluted, making simple task of adding a friend needlessly hard -Poorly updated Resolutions -Constant glitches (Mouse gets stuck, Game crashes, cant join servers,), -Bugged quest menu that crashes your game after finishing a quest or gets frozen for 5 minutes. -You cant map all your keys, the game has few keys for items hard-coded meaning if you put a potion in same spot and try to quickly use your skill, IT will drink you potion (and you cant change this) Customization and options are limited, the in game art is low-res and not updated -Only 4 out of 20 original characters are available and despite that, their Jobs (class changes) still dont have Extra skills, meaning you will mostly stick to your first job as its one you can customize most. -Limited SKill points meaning you cant learn every skill and this is one of those old games that you have to pay to reset your skills, and even tho this is the case there are QUESTS that force you to use certain skills that you may not even have in order to finish them. -Shops dont sell equipment as they used to, you cant buy weapons and armor, nor can you buy the important items such as Champion Tickets like you used to witch are used to play in champion versions of missions where most people farmed for items, pets and gear. They are limited reward from a mission (like 3 of them) and in order to finish some quests for your characters promotion, YOU NEED to play in champion mode (like 6 times, do you see the problem?). -Reward tables are nerfed and the game is Grindier -Player abilities are nerfed and due to poor descriptions of the skill you cant know for sure how good the skill is until you use it, but you cant have all the skills so you will have to gamble before you know what to build. the game does have a Practice mode you can access to test all those skills, but its only for pvp mode, and skills work differently on monsters (For example Poison arrow in pvp stops Mp Regen.. In pve it does MINOR, Tiny amount of dmg over time, i had to gamble and spend my skillpoints before i realized its a bad skill and i just wasted SP) so you will still be in the dark. -Even if pvp is your thing, dont worry, the connectivity is a mess and you will crash half the time as you enter the combat. -Items arent shared between characters, you no longer have One large inventory that you expand as you play the game and where all your resources are stashed, rather each character has its own inventory  and any items or rare materials you find... will be stuck with that character. Of-course Warehouse is still a thing and you can move items there, But Again most items Like actual Pets, Rare materials, Some weapons and armors and Trinkets, Accessories and items are unable to be moved to Warehouse, making it virtually useless. -You no longer have a home, some of you might remember that, you could grow fruits and power up trough various buffs, That has been scrapped... -But its alright because you can now randomly find 4 different peaces of Kazz'aze map around the world and use it to craft Hero Coins, and you will need that glory because Cruicible and other hero dungeons are un-beatable. Game claims that levels 40-80 can combat it but iv been in there multiple times (with lvl 60+ parties) and you can fight normal enemies fine.. but the boss will wipe out your party in a moment. On old exploit i remember was running the dungeon naked with only a weapon, it made enemies easier to deal with, that has been fixed, effectively nerfing players ability to fight and gain even ground while making the dungeon near impossible. And this lack of balance extends to rest of the dungeons as well. -Its heavily pay to win, seeing that you can buy various crafting items and armors with actuall money, and issue is that even if you are a pay to win you will struggle because the expensive crafting items you get to boost the power if your weapons still have a chance to fail, and in this kind of game, that can DESTROY echanting stones and waste all your money. If im PAYING for something it should never be a ""Maybe"". If i give you money i should get the item i want. Free to plays can only upgrade up to a limit before the game gives them a ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ And there are... a bunch.. of more things that i dont have time to mention because this review would be 20 pages long ----𝐈𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐅𝐀𝐋𝐋𝐎𝐔𝐓 𝟕𝟔 𝐋𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐫𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐞, 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐛𝐮𝐠𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐡𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐛---- The Ugly - The game is a Copy of the old game from 10 years ago, With very small changes and a lot of content cut. The game was grindy before but but its far worse due to lack of shared inventory, missions and unique quests being locked to higher levels and behind extreamly dificult challanges. While i can understand ""Clasic"" aspect of it a reason to keep things like they were, they still found ways to do very little while taking away so much, i am also nostalgic for the game and i have played it for 3 days now, giving it an honest shot and trying to document changes and see what is different. Another huge issue worth mentioning is that the game and its way of monetizing is right out of 2000's. Where Pay to win formula worked, this is 2021, these style of games have long since been outdated and there is a good reason nobody uses that anymore. While the game is nostalgic gateway to those old times, it still has issues that it had even back then, and i fear it wont survive this climate if it doesnt adapt and modernize, and if this poor, buggy, unbalanced, uncustomizable and overblown launch is any indication of how KOG treats their game, it will quickly fail like it did so many years ago. And this saddens me. My prediction is that they will slowly release old characters and content with very little change compared to the old game to give people a feeling of ""progress"" and keep the servers running for a while to cashgrab and get some money of peoples nostalgia. I genuinely hope the game survives and they actually work with the community to update and make the game decent, actually introducing proper content and pushing the game beyond what it once was, But knowing KOG's reputation, seeing their past actions and seeing how underwhelming and poor this release was... i dont have high hopes. This review was long but i did my best to speak from the heart and underline some issues. Best we can do now is wait and see what they do, either way. ill hope for the best, prepare for the worst.",0,GRANDCHASE
2021-09-18,"Posted: September 18, 2021 Pretty dogsh*t game if I'm honest. - No updates or improvements from when the game shut down in 2015 or so. - Drip-releasing content for a game that is probably older than your son. - 20 characters are not playable. False advertisement. They're re-releasing characters every 3 weeks or longer. Unacceptable. You have the files. Release them. Nobody wants to wait until December to play their favorite AP/Hybrid characters. - Over-nerfing characters to the point where you probably need to play in a party, which would be ok if this game wasn't dead on arrival. * Whoever was in charge of the game design literally kept all of the bad changes made to the game after Season V/Chaos. Shared inventory between characters but separate soulbinding inventory for the things that cost you money or time [Think of the soulbind system in TERA]. Are you f*cking my gay ass rn? You mean to tell me all my characters can clutter my puny inventory space of 110 with the garbage that drops in dungeons, but if I get a Boss Crest, Pet Manual, or a Sealbreaker pet, I can only bind it to ONE of my characters? There is nothing worth purchasing in the GP shop because you can't buy any armor sets or weapons anymore. Pray to the mercy of RNG that the dungeon gives you an upgrade and since there is no good re-roll system because the property scrolls are cash only AND random resets [meaning you can't pick which substats you get], you will most likely be stuck with useless armor. It's a very similar notion to artifact farming in Genshin Impact. Potions are ridiculously expensive. You can easily spend millions of GP on them [and you'll probably have to because everything hits way harder than it used to]. No current way to purchase Champion Mode tickets because for some damn reason, they cost VP now. Why would you gate harder content behind points or real life currency? Are you dumb? - Bosses get to spam their move sets millions of times in 20 frames [which is a bug that's been here since 2014] and you won't get to counter any of it because they gutted MP recovery. Very cool balancing decision. - VIP points are inaccessible to South Americans [which is funny considering they make up most of the playerbase] because of zero localization of currency. It's also pretty expensive for NA and everyone else considering what they're offering in the game. [Which is nothing]. Devs get a shout out for not fixing a single game breaking bug in beta and let it patch live but will fix exploits on the dot. - Very clear indication that this is a desperate cash grab from KOG management/marketing department since their other dying cow Elsword isn't doing too well. - Controls are still clunky and unresponsive as if this game was made in 2007 or something. Oh wait. - Releasing popular Sealbreaker GACHA sets right out the gate back to back [Rexion, Sirius. What's next? Sellion?] without the characters people like to play is honestly a spit in everyone's face. It's not even the good kind of Sealbreaker sets either because it's just skins with stats when they used to be Relic Armor sets. The only thing going for this system is that you can't get dupes like you can in Elsword with Ice Burners, which isn't an incredibly high bar. Think: ""our expectations for you were low, but HOLY F*CK"". Oh, and remember how the old Sealbreaker Armor sets had some sort of pity system where you spend a certain amount to get the entire set? Yeah, no. This coordi gacha version is a straight up zero pity system. I've heard people varying from spending 120~300+ USD for ONE set. $120 being more expensive than I've ever paid for a lv 80 Sealbreaker Armor set in old GrandChase before they changed all of the sets to purely skins with stats. WAY too expensive for what it is. If I wanted to play a money sink game, catch me on Genshin Impact. Once you put the nostaljuice down, you'll realize that your time is better spent playing Toontown Rewritten. Drop the copium-- here's a personal f*ck you to KoG. Edited: 10/03/21: As you can see, I've played additional hours since my last review to test out the new patch. - Amy came out and she might be the worst character so far. Heavily nerfed. She used to be good support with respectable damage. She is currently neither of these. Does less damage than Elesis. Her 4th bars are ASS. Her healing is ASS outside of 1st job. Starlet is a buggy mess. Her Godzilla slides toward the border of the map, making you miss most of the damage in her laser beam. A lot of her 3MP moves are weaker, including both support and fighting. If you want a support who does damage, play Alchemist. [Yes, Amy is THAT bad]. - Gee, another popular Sealbreaker Gacha set, Ordo Squad. I hear Sellion's coming out next. Y'all are that desperate for money, huh? Maybe instead of releasing skins you have to pay 160+ USD for, you should focus on bug fixes, QOL patches, and perhaps fundamental game design changes. The reason I stopped playing GC was because your account went from feeling cohesive to divided, giving all of your characters their own inventory and progress in the world. Anything you got with your own money could now only be used for one of your characters. On top of that, all the cash items you spent were immediately power-crept by the new system. It's one thing to piss off your F2P players but when you piss off your whales and they leave, the game no longer gets the funding it needs to keep running. KOG, you seem to be headed in the same direction as you were in years prior. Please explain to me why most of the player base would even feel attracted to spend $160 on skins? I would gladly shell out $160 per character if it meant I got armor that lasted me through endgame. After looking through the VP shop, they are selling Single Property reset scrolls where you can spend a whopping 8.5K points to pick 1 stat to re-roll of your choosing on any item you want. Relic Armor if memory serves me right, have 4 stats. Imagine spending $25 per equip [at worst if all your rolls are sh*t.] You're spending $200 + whatever $ for Sealbreaker you buy because only tryhards would min-max the game in its current awful state. Why is everything in this game so expensive? This game is not even at the standard of most other games with MTX and your content per coin is way less. Make this make sense. - People are still advertising hacks every hour on the hour. Fix the megaphone/announcement system so that it is way more expensive in VP so that people can't just spam their advertisements for hacks or get rid of this feature completely. - Playtesting Amy lv. 1~85, not a single person joined any of my rooms. This game is truly dead. Shame they've nerfed characters for teamplay aspect but NOBODY is even online to play.",0,GRANDCHASE

I never hated a character more until I had to fight Lady Butterfly.  Then about 20 hours in, I just got it.  I understood.

2021-05-13,"Posted: May 13, 2021 I was bored, and saw that this game won game of the year, so I bought it. After playing this game for two and a half hours, dying repeatedly to the game's first mini-boss, I contacted steam and demanded a refund for a game I simply couldn't play. ...but I couldn't get it out of my head. I got the game again for Christmas, and after finally killing that first mini-boss, I couldn't get over how I felt. I kept going, perfecting the fighting style until I reached the game's first real boss. It knocked me down again. I fought that boss over and over again until the swordplay became a lethal kind of dance. I felt invincible. After the first boss, I went onto the next one, and the next, until I completed the game's first ending. Then I played it all again, exploring the abilities, fighting styles, and story arcs that I hadn't tried before. I reached the game's truly final boss and killed it in one try because the game had trained me to fight so well. It was by far the most rewarding experience any video game has ever given me. After over 150 hours, I earned every single achievement. From someone who refunded this game the first day they played it, from someone who would have never been remotely interested in Japanese culture otherwise, let me tell you that Sekiro is one of a kind. Not only is the combat an art-form in and of itself, but the story is moving and the characters compelling. If you buy Sekiro, don't get frustrated when you hit a wall. Don't look up cheese strategies or try to savescum the game. Get back up, watch a walkthrough or two if you really need to, and vault over that wall like a f***ing shinobi. You won't regret it.",1,SEKIRO: SHADOWS DIE TWICE

2024-07-16,"Posted: July 16 4.5k hours on Steam 1k hours on Origin Day 1 player 1000's of Euros spent on the game over 5 years, own many heirlooms and multiple prestige skins. I uninstalled after the Double Take collection event, before the battlepass changes were announced. The battlepass announcement only confirmed the correctness of my decision. What a disgrace of a studio (Respawn Entertainment) and what a disgrace of a publisher (EA). Titanfall died for this. Slap in the face after slap in the face, I would have to be a total masochist to continue giving them money just to be miserable all the time. They knew what they were in for with the new monetization system announcement, that's why they announced it so early on, a month before the season's release. They're hoping the anger will die down by the time Season 22 comes out. This game is plagued with problems that are continuously ignored. The studio is horrendous at communication with the playerbase and only seeks to nickel and dime the players, to milk this game dry for every cent. They expect us to shell out more and more while the quality of the game's content is this poor? SKINS ARE NOT CONTENT. As an MNK player, I could not stand to play another match of this game. I will list some of the glaring issues of the game, which developers have not fixed 5 years into the game: - Broken, poor quality audio system. No footstep audio in extremely important situations, abilities that fail to produce sounds, etc. This has been a problem for 5 years and the devs have removed a modifiable setting which applied a bandaid to the issue. - Rampant cheaters, completely understaffed security team. There has only ever once been a situation comparable to the cheater epidemic now and that was around 2 - 3 years ago. Search the internet for articles about the ""ALGS hack"". This happened in the middle of the biggest Apex tournament series, the official Apex Legends Global Series (ALGS). - No competitive integrity due to, among other factors, a ridiculously unbalanced input (controller) overshadowing MNK. Respawn should have never allowed input mixing, much less so in COMPETITIVE. - Poorly organized, neglected competitive scene. Because of Respawn and EA, it can't reach its potential. - Servers filled with actual bots - Poor quality servers that crash very often for very many, packet loss, code:nets in the middle of ALGS - No region lock so you are forced to play against players on 150 - 200+ ping who, because of the design of the netcode will take you down from behind closed doors and other types of cover. - Unbelievable visual clutter (only addressed years ago with a half-baked muzzle flash update which failed to fix the issues and then years down the line with some adjustments to the L-Star projectiles - no fix for snow, dust, abilities, etc.) - Aim punch / flinch on no armor (completely unaddressed by the developers) - Power creep for legends which makes legends like Wraith and Ash useless - Weapon balancing that favors nerfs over buffs to have many viable weapons. The R-301 is useless. Havoc and Hemlok have been meta for an absurd amount of time and the ""nerf"" the Havoc received is a joke that fails to address any of the fundamental issues. The R-99 was nerfed into the ground as nothing more than a band-aid fix for the absurdity of Aim Assist. SMGs as a class were nerfed (move speed for example) for that reason. Shotguns are useless outside of solos. The game is moving towards higher and higher TTK. - The game is more and more oriented towards abilities than raw gunplay. Press one button for free 75 HP (Revenant). Press one button for free height which allows you to pop a battery almost unscathed. Press one button to spam the enemy with knuckle clusters. Press one button for free shield regen (Conduit). The list goes on and on and on. - Terrible ranked system with no incentives. The ranked rewards are laughable and the ranked trails have been retired in order to make trails monetizable, bundled with $140 - $150 Prestige Skins. - Terrible progression system with no incentives. The weapon mastery system is abysmal. - Terrible monetization, more and more gacha / gambling events that force you to gamble, going back on their promise during Iron Crown to always let players have a choice what to buy during events, with Apex Coins or Crafting Metals. Poorly designed, rushed, churned out universal heirlooms with no character, instead of legend heirlooms. Recycling skins in the form of recolors, recolors and more recolors. Recolored legend skins, recolored heirlooms... Abysmal, exorbitantly high price for Prestige Skins which you can't customize whatsoever and for which you can only see the hands and arms in first person. Multiple prestige skins do not even have dive trails. The Exotic Store is a joke with only 2 skins, rendering the Exotic Shards given in the battle pass effectively useless for the majority of players, who can't get heirloom shards. Crafting metals are useless because you have fewer and fewer avenues to spend them. - Legend tokens are deliberately made useless It took them: - 4 YEARS to add Mixtape and you can't choose which mode to play - 5 years to add queuing from inside a match (tested with the Straight Shot LTM and only finally implemented in Season 21) - 5 years to add guaranteed weapons on drop from supply bins Issues I take offence with as an MNK player: - Respawn refuse to allow input-based matchmaking or allow PC players to turn off crossplay, which means that MNK players are forced to play against legal soft aimbot in the form of Rotational Aim Assist which automatically tracks and has 0 ms reaction time. This is purely for monetary reasons, because the majority of the playerbase is on controller and easy 1 mag knocks feel good and make controller players more likely to spend money on the game. - Aim assist is completely unaffected by visual clutter and aim punch, which is in effect a nerf to MNK The game has turned into a participation trophy, spectator sport in which the game plays itself for people. It is becoming less and less about raw skill and more about how well one controller player's soft aimbot can do against another controller player's soft aimbot. Overall, Respawn does not care about MNK players. The experience of MNK players has been relegated to a mere afterthought After all of these issues, we are slapped with more skins in the shop, recolors, two battlepasses in one season. I won't get more into the battlepass monetization, but the ""extra value"" boils down to more crafting metals which are useless (less and less avenues to spend them, more gacha events), useless Apex Coins (2 premium battlepasses, so THREE MONTHS, only get you enough for 1 legendary skin, most players used the coins from the battlepass to repurchase it), useless exotic shards (you need 50 exotic shards to even get one weapon skin from the Exotic Store and there are only 2 skins in it, while using them for Universal Heirloom customization requires having the base, which costs 150 Heirloom Shards), a few more Apex Packs which are worthless (in my experience I had to literally open 500 packs or very close to 500 packs almost every time in order to get Heirloom Shards from the pity system). Now, instead of 2 Reactive Skins per battle pass, there is only 1. You are now forced to shell out $10 every split to get the battle pass. Another case of Fear-of-Missing-Out (FOMO) being utilized by Respawn for monetization, with the shortening of the battle passes and increase in frequency. If Respawn doesn't care about me, I would have to be insane to keep giving them money just to suffer more. If they won't respect my time, my effort, my skill, I won't respect their game. I will not recommend this game to anybody and frankly, this game does not deserve to stay alive with the direction it has and is taking. Very many of the original Respawn developers left for Wildlight Entertainment and Gravity Well. Titanfall died for this.",0,APEX

2015-12-01,"Posted: December 1, 2015 Early Access Review I've lived entire lives in this game.  Braved bitter winters.  Sorted and labeled crates of canned food, wondering how long it would last me.  Tended crops and cursed the misfortune of plant disease.  Fractured my leg and holed up in the corner of some dilapidated warehouse dying of thirst since I lacked the speed to get home safely.  I've lived a thousand lives and felt the touch of death so many times, now I'm only surprised when it doesn't come swiftly. What I've learned is that death isn't failure, no, it's a sweet release.  Make no mistake, I've survived for a long time, built impregnable safehouses with self-sustaining crops, high above where any zombie could reach.  But that is simply a different kind of death, death in the form of boredom, but it is a death all the same.  It makes sense though, doesn't it?  You are the last person on Earth, the world is filled with endless zombies, there is no happy ending to all of this. But the point isn't to survive, the point is to create your own tale, make a snapshot of experiences that are memorable.  This game is really just an analogy for life and death, compressed into a few hours at a time, and how you choose to spend your time reflects on your personality.  How will you keep death at bay?  Will you build walls, will you hide, will you run as far away as you can, or will you pick up an axe and try to fight it?  It doesn't matter, death will find you in the end, but it will be a hell of a journey.",1,PROJECT ZOMBOID
2021-12-20,"Posted: December 20, 2021 Early Access Review It's late night. On top of my exhaustion, I'm blinded by the absence of light. But I can't stop now. I've been walking for almost an entire day - although in my current state, this feels more like an eternity. My weary footsteps echo through the desolate, darkly moonlit roads. My previous safehouse was overwhelmed by a straggling horde the day before. I ran, only with a small bugout bag I could salvage while I drowned in desperation and fear. Finally, I stumble upon a new city, utterly fatigued, parched, and famished. Lost in the suffocating darkness, I desperately search for refuge, until my bleary eyes catch sight of a looming dark silhouette - a mansion, cloaked by the deepest shadow of the night. Feeling the walls in the dark, I am blessed with luck. This feels like an utter disrespect to the oppressive darkness around me. I managed to grasp the doorknob on my first attempt - and it is unlocked. Fumbling blindly, I confirm that every entry point on the ground floor remains sealed shut. Denying myself of solace, fearful of prying eyes or ears, I determine that my only sanctuary lies on the mansion's upper floor. I enter the suite, seeking shelter behind a fortress of barricaded doors and windows - the house's entrance, the bedroom's threshold, and ultimately, the final barrier of the bathroom door. Within those confines, I hope for the slightest reminiscence of peace, a fleeting moment of respite from the encroaching chaos outside. I pray that all these barriers that confine me within are enough for me to wake up from my slumber and muster the remaining of my dwindling vigor, in the chance that my new sanctuary is breached by the looming. With every ounce of strength left in my battered, punished body, I hasten towards my coveted sanctuary, yearning for a sip of the last water drops from the city water supply and eating the remains of my canned dog food. As I push open the bathroom door, the last portal to my salvation, fate unveils its malevolent mockery against me. I am not the only one who sought refuge within these walls. Another soul had the same idea before, sealing both our fates. Long ago, someone met their demise in this very room. Now, their lifeless corpse stands motionless, a grim sentinel guarding this bathroom. A puppet of chance, devoid of purpose, waiting for an unsuspecting prey - a perfectly set trap, just like a mousetrap anticipates its unwitting mouse. I swing the door open, a gateway to either salvation or damnation. But in my exhausted state, my famished and sleepless body is unable to react swiftly enough. The reanimated corpse lunges at me, its rotten fangs sinking deep into my jugular.",1,PROJECT ZOMBOID

Initially it was a good experience but as a new player, the last few runs were immediately shut down by what turned out to be max level players who, upon spectating would effectively speedrun the missions, running past/avoiding enemies to go hunt down players. New players, typically. Like myself. And my friends. Makes for a great first experience, 10/10 reliable way to dissuade new players from playing the game. I'd recommend it and I did have some fun, but that really just leaves a sour taste in your mouth to have that happen repeatedly, when you queue up for what is called ""casual"".

2024-07-21,"Posted: July 21 Early Access Review Here's a comment I made on a community post that I thought would make an okay review. Loving the game buuuuuuut... The problem with extraction games is the novelty drops off a cliff for me rather quickly. And I'm willing to bet I'm not alone. Tarkov was great, until it became impossible to extract. Marauders rocked... until it became impossible to extract. My cousin and I are enjoying this WAAAAY more than D&D'er. We've had much more success extracting. And Mithril runs are a wonderful addition. They might just be the one thing that keeps us coming back. That being said, we're old(er). He's in his 50's and I'm in my 40's. We have jobs, families, responsibilities that make game time limited. Constantly dying to neck beards gets incredibly frustrating, very quick. ""Git Gud"" isn't the answer. This is as good as I'm ever going to get. Why? Well, for starters, see above. I don't have time to devote to ""gitting gud"". Also, my hand/eye ain't what it used to be and neither is my reaction time. Also, also, whenever I start getting decent gear guess what happens?! Yup, I get bumped up in lobby tier and 3 sweats come along, 2 hit me, and all my gear is gone. All I know is that folks like me will revert back to our other games that provide the dopamine we crave, without the frustration. The community will dwindle over time, and less and less players will be online. Go check the Marauders reddit to see what that's like. It all comes down to balance, or a lack thereof. Tiered lobbies alone doesn't seem to work.  There's always going to be a top and bottom to the tier. Maybe some buffs for those recently killed by players and nerfs for those who kill. Give players a reason to think twice about attacking and/or find a reason to potentially risk an attack. Some kind of bounty program that would encourage members of a lobby to work together against a common enemy? I can't repeat enough how awesome the option to Mithril run is though! It's a VERY welcome addition to allow for playtime, farming mats, and taking out gear fear. If you're struggling but want to keep playing this game, do those runs! That's my thoughts.

2024-07-20,"Posted: July 20 Early Access Review I couldn't really get into Dark and Darker, but I really enjoy this game. It feels much more accessible in so many ways and while it can still be challenging and punishing at times, it feels more fair and rewarding overall. As far as free to play games or early access games go, it has a decent approach to content. The main game mode has you drop into a map to explore it for loot, maybe kill some NPC enemies or other players, and then find a portal to get out, with you risking losing everything you brought if you die. What I like most is that you can unlock items to cheaply craft between runs and improve the starting gear you have access to. So instead of starting with bottom tier gear every time if you get on a bit of a streak of losses, you can craft some better gear and head in with that. Even better, there's another mode called the Mythril Order you can play with 3 preset classes to choose from and 4 levels of reputation you can gain with them that offers access to more and better gear to choose from in that mode. You don't bring any of your main stuff into that, nor do you keep anything you find. Instead, it all gets scrapped and sold for resources used by your main character to craft, buy, or unlock new gear-so you can farm resources risk free. It's the same map and mode as the main game-you just play as a slightly different class than you have access for the main part of the game. Then there's the pvp. I honestly really like this in the game, too. At the start of a 3v3 team deathmatch round, you get to pick from a set of purple (2nd highest) tier gear for whatever class you wanna play as, and then you head into the arena to practice the combat systems against other players completely risk free. You don't earn anything if you win, but you don't lose anything if you lose. It's just a great way to practice pvp against other players should you run into them in the main game. Speaking of, there are a decent amount of classes to choose from already with more hopefully on the way (no ranger class or bows seems like the oddly lacking them and I wish they were in there). They don't all have multiple skills/abilities to choose from yet, but eventually they should. Currently the Cryomancer, Priest, Death Knight, and 1 or 2 others have multiple to choose from. The Cryomancer and Death Knight are undead characters that don't use mana for their abilities, but instead rely on life energy dropped by anything that dies in the map. Simply walk over it and you restore lose energy. I really like how the different abilities by the different classes can pair with each other against the NPC enemies/bosses and other players. Even though I've lost most encounters against other players, it doesn't really feel that unfair and I feel like I have a chance to win even against players wearing higher tier gear than me. It can also be fun to have runs ended because a bunch of players found each other in the map and the whole thing devolved into utter chaos. You still keep the xp earned from the match even if you lose your loot and at least for me, it feels like there's a 4 or 5 to 1 ratio on runs you escape with loot versus runs you die to other enemies, a player, or from not finding enough portals for your whole team to get out. Speaking of-and I hope they don't patch/change this-you can currently drop your stuff if you know you're not making it out and your teammate(s) can grab it for you and it will be returned to you via the in game mailbox immediately after they successfully portal out of the map/match. It's a very nice mechanic that allowed me to save a blue tier sword I bought from the merchant in between matches when we couldn't find a 2nd portal for me to get out of a match once. There's no battle pass, there are like 5 or 6 cosmetics currently that you could seemingly even spend real money on and while it sucks they're doing the classic premium currency thing of always having a bit left over after a purchase, there's absolutely no reason to spend money on the game if you don't want to and the only thing other players are getting from doing so is admittedly cool looking devil horns and maybe another cosmetic or 2 that makes them easier to spot in the map. I think there are even ways to earn some of the premium currency in game based on seeing a free and a paid count for it in the currencies tab. In all, I highly recommend this over Dark and Darker or if you're remotely interested in these extraction style games. This one seems highly rewarding and respectful of your time. Once you unlock a weapon or other piece of gear to craft, it only costs about 360 gold to craft another basic version of it (you can spend more to upgrade and augment your unlocked craftable gear) and the average piece of even the crappiest gear or straight sellable items is 50 gold each. I think I was averaging 2k-3k a run in gold, plus you could do daily, weekly, or seasonal challenges that potentially also pay more gold. It's not very hard to come by and the personal stash you can use to keep items for all your characters to wear only costs 5k gold to buy your first extra tab for it. They even also give you 20 of the resources for crafting healing items in between runs for free at the merchant and you can use them to craft up to 7 healing or mana potions or bandages to bring on future runs. They boasted a goal of trying to be true free to play and at least so far, it really seems like they're delivering. I hope more free to play games adopt a model like this. It's the kind of model that makes me more willing to spend money on it cause I feel like I'm having a lot of fun in a pretty good game as opposed to being punished for not spending money to skip an arbitrary grind imposed by some of the free to play games out there.",1,DUNGEONBORNE

2024-02-26,"Posted: February 26 I saw the hype online and pretty much ignored it until one of those late-night ""I'm bored, what should I do?"" moments. I'm about 15 hours in, which isn't bad for me as a fairly casual gamer. Here's a quick story from last night: Had trouble finding a mission that I could actually connect to, so I decided to just poke around on my own to get some practice on Hard. I'm about ten minutes in and get totally swamped with bots from all sides. My sentries are putting in work, but I'm on my last mag and am basically sprinting through the forest to find some cover. I try to hit my resupply and accidentally hit the SOS thing. I swear it wasn't more than 15 seconds and a couple of folks jump into the mission. The first thing I hear on the mic? ""Stay strong, brother. We're here to help."" These guys totally bulldoze through the next couple of bases and help me smash the last Hulk before a really gnarly exfil. I then played another THREE HOURS with the same squad. When they finally said that they had to hop off, I thanked them for the rescue. Their response? ""For democracy"". Holy hell this is the game. ******* EDIT 4/29/24 Holy crap - you guys are insane! Thanks for all the love! Lots of naysayers in the comments, and fair enough. I will say though that this really did happen and it really did get me to fall in love with the game. It's probably not reflective of the overall experience, but I still think of this weird experience just about every time I log into the game.",1,HELLDIVERS 2

2021-09-29,"Posted: September 29, 2021 My entire colony was saved by a tortoise. This won't be a review like the ones I normally do, going over the pros and cons. Rimworld's a story generator, so I thought I'd share my story. I bought rimworld around two weeks prior to writing this, and set up a small colony. The first animal my colonists tamed was a 212 year old tortoise, who I named ""Old Timer."" We set up a small farm, and once we found a female tortoise (who I named ""Henrietta Peach""), they had kids. And their kids had kids. Soon enough, I had too many tortoises than I knew what to do with, so i tried selling them, and the nearby colonists loved them. But things took a darker turn. Around 5 days after buying rimworld, my IRL dog, of 15 years, passed. It was sad, but what hit extra hard was old timer's death only a few hours later. Both were blind, both had bad backs - it hurt, and I cried. I dug a big tomb in a mountain for old timer, and laid him to rest in it. But this is not where his story ends. A few ingame hours later, I got a quest with a ressurection serum as a reward. In that moment, I knew what I had to do, as the end goal of my playthrough. I couldn't save my dog from old age, but I sure as could save this turtle. Old timer was going to space. After quickly gunning down some tribals and getting the serum, I needed a way to keep old timer from dying all over again while I aquired the supplies for the ship. Luckily, an ancient ruin was on my map, and after an intense fight with some killer robots, I safely placed him in a stasis chamber the robots were guarding. Not much happened relating to him. Henrietta died of old age herself, and over the four or so years it took me to complete the ship, old timer's children numbered over 500. i made regular trips to the nearby towns to trade tortoises for the ship's supplies, like plasteel and uranium, and at long last, I placed old timer in the now-finished ship and turned the reactor on. When you power on the escape reactor, rimworld basically becomes a sort of wave defense game, with a new posse of enemies coming every day for 15 days or so while the reactor charged. This wasn't a big deal - I had troops in power armor with miniguns, and we made it to the end of the 15 days without any deaths. Right as the reactor was at full power, and I told my colonists to enter the ship, things took a dramatic turn. A solar flare knocked out all my defences, leaving me without any kind of fire support. I hurredly got my colonists in the ship, but right as the last one was making his way across the fields to get to it... Pirates airdropped into my base. I was screwed. I was about to launch without him, when salvation came in a way I hadn't expected: A tortoise (number 493, to be precise) didn't take too kindly to someone coming out of the sky and attempting to shoot his keepers, and bit a pirate enforcer on the leg. This caused the pirate to hit him with his club, and after that the OTHER pirates started shooting the hundred or so turtles in the base, who promptly attacked back. And, in the ensuing chaos, my last colonist boarded the ship and we escaped. Old timer, a blind, crippled, undead tortoise repaid me for saving his life - by birthing countless decendants to not only fund my escape, but who also protected me in my darkest hour of need. This game is a gift, and I cannot reccommend it enough. Even if you reload saves to keep the story going how you want, it's still a story worth telling. 10/10: The first game to make me cry.",1,RIMWORLD

The initial explosion was fairly well contained but the heat from the fire raised the temperature in the communal hall to several hundred degrees in about 15 seconds then all the furniture caught fire as well. there was nowhere for the heat to go and relatively little space to heat up so it turned the whole place into a furnace, even the coolers caught fire, then the food caught fire. The communal hall included all the hallways that went throughout my base (ironically to make temperature control easier) so there was no way to get out of the base other than to go through the communal hall. One dumbass died in the initial explosion, three caught fire in the halls before reaching the shelter of the adjacent rooms, those already in those rooms caught fire as they were dying of heatstroke, the communal hall reached over two thousand degrees Celsius. There were no survivors.",1,RIMWORLD

2017-01-18,"Posted: January 18, 2017 Early Access Review I felt like I had to share my experiences with RimWorld so far ... So I had just established my young but promising new colony, Ashton (a quite ironical name in the end ...). The basic needs were all covered, everyone had a nice place to sleep, decent clothing, enough to eat and time to relax. The people of Ashton were prosperous. They lived in harmony with nature and each other. Their wide fields provided them with plenty of food and they sold the surplus to the passing by caravans. Now and then a few warriors of a near tribe, the Pig Face Men, attacked the settlement, but the people of Ashton were safe, relying on the strength of their automated defence systems. And so the colony grew and I thought: This is it, I finally have a colony which doesn't collapse after a few hours. As if ... Remember when I told you about the harmony between the people and with nature? I meant there were no rivalries between the colonists, most were friends and there even was a married couple, Tali and Waltz. The harmony with nature also seems pretty coherent; the people relied mostly on their crops, eating only those animals which died by natural causes (e.g. old age or other animals), so the animal population in the near forests remained stable. So far so good. But taking those dead animals in meant of course someone had to leave the safe area of Ashton and wander through the wilds. Normally that wouldn't have been a problem, everyone was equipped with guns and armor of the Pig Face Men so they were quite ready to take on anything coming in their way. But then came the tortoise. Waltz left Ashton to get the still fresh corpse of a chinchilla which had been killed by some other animal. So Waltz has just grabbed it, when a tortoise nearby turned mad. I thought ok, those aren't that fast, Waltz will be able to safely carry the chinchilla inside and the turrets will take care of the tortoise. Nope! I'm not quite sure what exactly happened, maybe this animal was on speed or something like thak. Anyway, when it saw Waltz it charged at him at a horrifying pace. Waltz had just lifted his weapon when this damn creature reached and hurt him badly. However, its hard shell was no match for Waltz' gun. And so he came back home, injured but happy, that now there was even more meat than expected. But the wraith of the tortoise was unforgiving. The bite wounds in his upper body infected themselves. The medical treatment didn't work and he got weaker and weaker. If the infection at least would've been in one of his limbs, that might had saved him, but you can't just amputate someones chest. At last he couldn't fight any longer, the infection overwhelmed him. Tali, his wife, carved his story in the sides of his sarcophagus. The burial ceremony was heartbreaking. Everyone had come: Tali, his sister Julia, his friends Vas, Jones, Stephan, Boyd and Leia, Vas' tame wolf Nevile and Bacon 1 and Bacon 2. In the light of the evening sun they all waved a last goodbye to their fallen husband, brother and friend, before the people of Ashton went to bed. With Waltz dead or not, they had to cary on. But apparently it was all too much for Tali, not very surprising if you think about it. There was only this one little problem: She was a pyromaniac. When the rest of the colony slept, she left her big and empty bed. Driven crazy by grief, she did the only thing able to ease her pain. She set the forest on fire. Finally, exhausted almost to unconciousness, she fell back into her bed again. While she slept, the others, waken by the crackling fire, desperately tried to put out the flames which already started to spread over to the buildings. But they simply weren't enough, they could either try to save the buildings or the forest, not both. Of course they tended to the buildings, to the food storage to be exact. However it gave the fire the chance to spread through the forest, completely sorrounding the settlement. In the end it was all too much. Tali died in her own fire that she refused to extinguish, Jones and Boyd followed when they collapsed in the infernal heat. And then, when no hope was left, the gods, the ancestors, the Flying Spaghetti Monster or whatever thi people of Ashton believed in, heard their cries. Rain started falling down, putting out the fire. But it was too late. More than three quarters of the colony had been taken by the flames. Vas, Stephan and Leia were unconcious. Julia was the only one still able to stand. She did what she could, but with all the medicine burned she had no chance. Leia died first, Vas second. This caused his wolf Nevile, who had been laying loyal by his side, to turn mad like the damn tortoise and he ripped the still unconcious Stehpan into pieces before he went on attacking a herd of muffalos (some kind of marshmellow like buffalos) which was his end. Traumatised Julia, who managed to flee when Stephan was killed, wandered through the burnt ruins of Ashton. Blackened stone walls and pieces of charcoal everywhere. All the food they stored for the winter was gone, the fields empty. With no medicine left and her own wounds hurting worse and worse, Julia found a last smokeleaf joint in one of the destroyed buildings. She leant against her brother's sarcophagus and lit it. So she didn't feel anything when the Pig Face Men attacked. With the solar panels a loss to the flames, the turrets didn't react when Ashton's last inhabitant finally exhaled her last breath. 12 / 10 - Creates more immersive storys than many RPGs; looking forward to my next colony (and possibly its desastrous destruction ...).

2023-08-13,"Posted: August 13, 2023 I had a cool doctor in my colony, but he got old and lost his hearing. I decided to replace his ears with bionic ones, but I didn’t notice that he was a Body Purist who hated artificial body parts. While he was lying on the operating table and recovering from the surgery, a huge raid happened. The raiders built siege weapons and attacked us with rockets and mortars. I managed to fight them off, but one of my colonists died. It was the doctor’s spouse. The doctor woke up with pain, grief, and anger. He dug up his spouse’s corpse and brought it to the main hall, where he laid it on a table. This made everyone else unhappy and stressed. One of my colonists was a cannibal, and he was hungry and wounded from the raid. He saw the corpse on the table and decided to eat it. This triggered a mental breakdown in the doctor, who attacked the cannibal. They started a brawl that soon involved other colonists. One of my colonists was a pyromaniac, and he was also stressed and angry. He grabbed a flamethrower and started to set everything on fire. The fire spread quickly and engulfed most of the base. The doctor had an infection from the surgery, and he was bleeding and feverish. He was also the best doctor in the colony, so no one else could treat him properly. He died on the floor, surrounded by flames and blood. By the time a mysterious stranger in a cloak came to help us (when everyone was downed and helpless), it was too late. Most of the base was burned down, and most of the colonists were dead or dying. The only survivor was the drug addict, who had taken all the drugs in the colony and wandered off to a meadow. He died there peacefully. Rimworld is a perfect story-generator.",1,RIMWORLD
2017-06-03,"Posted: June 3, 2017 If you're thinking of buying this game, stop hesitating and purchase it, immediately. I started an isolated research facility on a frozen wasteland, as a 74-year-old sociopathic scientist called Geckulon Decktar; I researched robotics to begin with, and constructed some automatons to handle the menial tasks like cleaning, cooking and hauling, etc, leaving me free to conduct my research. All was well- until a band of savages laid siege to my settlement. I barely survived- but resolved to increase my security, installing several auto-turrets around my perimeter. This would keep the ruffians at bay for a time, but I needed a longer term solution- so I turned my focus to bionic enhancements. I wanted to turn the human form into the ultimate living weapon. When a faction of slavers passed through my frozen wasteland, I did not hesitate to inspect their wares. I wanted a slave, but not just any slave- he should be foreboding, brutal and utterly without mercy! And that was when I found him. His name was Skint Mcgruff. He was a feared crime lord when they captured him, infamous for killing and then devouring the people who wronged him. I paid the slavers their due and took Skint in. I fed him (alas, not the human meat he desired, but nutrient paste, made from potatoes- poor fare, but such is life in the frozen wastes) and I clothed him. By now I was confident in my ability to improve upon the human form, and so I presented the idea to him the very next day. He was keen- particularly about the notion of having retractable claws- and so the work began. My medical droid handled most of the surgery, but I crafted the bionic components myself. It was a long and grueling process, but eventually, he was complete. More machine now than man, I felt it necessary to rename him... to symbolise his departure from prosaic humanity to something more, and thus I named him C.A.N.N.I.B.A.L (Cybernetic Armoured Neutraliser with Neurally Integrated Bionic Attack Limbs). He is my pride and joy... bionic eyes that can see even in the dark, bionic legs that allow him to sprint faster than a cheetah, and retractable claws with which to tear out the throats of my foes, and of course, I give him leave to feast on their corpses afterward as a reward. Now, I can finally conduct my research in peace...",1,RIMWORLD

2024-07-30,"Posted: July 30 Early Access Review Hmm... I wish there was a ""mixed"" option in Steam reviews because that's how I'm actually feeling about this since it's July 30th EA launch. I'm one of the very early supporters back during its Kickstarter campaign, so I've seen how much this game as evolved since its alpha build. With that said, however, this EA launch leaves me troubled, especially around its campaign (which is what I usually look for in a great RTS to play in my free time). To avoid spoilers: the story is rather rushed and you get very little feel for the world or the characters by the time the provided missions are complete. The primary reason I could keep up with much of it is because I took half an hour to read through the in-game ""CODEX"" (located at the top center on the starting window where you choose which game mode to play) that has little entries on each character and location introduced in these available mission packs. Normally, that would be fine, especially for a game in EA. However, the last mission in the ""Chapter 1"" set has a story beat that feels like a major plot point and a traditional end to a classic RTS campaign vis-a-vis WC3 or SC1, and we're only on mission six of the entire game! I was willing to overlook much, if not most, of the beta and EA messiness knowing that its development is still in process; ""let them keep cooking,"" I kept telling myself. Yet, I now find myself hesitating with where they seem to be taking this new IP. Moreover, how the game adds ""lore bits"" through ""text drops"" that you have to pick up with your hero and then read in the lower right corner of your screen after hovering your cursor over its ""book icon"" in thin, white font while the game keeps playing (because there's no pausing in the campaign, even when you bring up the main menu) was tedious at best and frustrating at worst. On top of that, most of the lore bits were random ""jokes"" or ""gags"" that were neither funny (to me) or really added to the world/lore of the game. Those that weren't jokes didn't really add anything to the mission story-wise nor strategy-wise. So I often felt frustrated that I was essentially being distracted from an actively running mission with little to no reward or meaningful lore to enjoy. More importantly, there is no manual saving, reloading, or restarting in the campaign missions whatsoever that are already single player to start with. Yes, there are some checkpoints, and if you reach a failure state in a given mission, then you can choose to reload from the latest checkpoint. But if you want to restart a mission that's already going poorly for you or try something different without restarting the entire mission, you're fresh out of luck at the moment. It's either fail and reload from checkpoint or quit all the way back to the campaign menu and reload the entire mission, including all the mission briefing and cinematics (that you can skip through one-by-one) and loading screens before you can start playing the mission again. All of that was quite frustrating when you're trying out a brand new campaign/mission for the very first time, especially on a brutal run like I did! Finally, I understand full well that as a F2P game by design, Frost Giant needs to monetize things like mission packs, co-op commanders, and cosmetics to help keep their budget in the green (although, I will say that I was peeved that the second Infernal commander is pay-walled for players like me who ""purchased"" the Ultimate Founders Pack ""pre-order"" at $60 USD; you'd think they would give us that before they started charging us for later content?), and I'm willing to consider supporting that business model if it means the base game remains F2P so new players can join the RTS ecosystem both here and the wider RTS community. But... if the overall campaign ends up being as poor quality as this EA launch suggests, then I'll probably wait for potential discounts before chipping in anymore money myself in the future. I can go on about the game's current PvE AI, frustrating unit pathing, story character models that pull me out of the immersion for how bizarre they come across every time I see them (think uncanny valley kind of cognitive repulsion, honestly) , but this review is already getting a bit long... ...I really want this game and developer to succeed, truly! But I am, for the first time, actually disappointed with this latest direction of the game at its EA launch. I hope Frost Giant makes some adjustments---at least with solo-play mechanics---before the well of goodwill and player eagerness dries up. * NOTE: I'm more than willing to update this review after significant changes have occurred with my gripes above as the game (hopefully) develops over its EA window [playstormgate.com] . *",0,STORMGATE
2024-08-01,"Posted: August 1 Early Access Review You can take the developer out of Blizzard, but you can't take Blizzard out of the developer. Many of us supported this game because we wanted to see it succeed.  A lot of us are hundreds of dollars deep into this game already.  Why are there pre-day 1 microtransactions that we don't own?  Was my $360 not enough?  Now I need to be nickel and dimed with additional paid content on the first day of early access?  Yes they gave me what was promised on Kickstarter.  It still feels like a slap in the face that there is content in the game I don't own, literally before the game has even released. The campaign is terrible.  We're paying at least $5 per mission.  It's almost like this is a meta commentary on people caring too much about the campaign so they purposely made it as horrible as they could.  Maybe this is genius.  The writing, the artstyle, this game isn't winning in any category.  I have the graphics maxed out, the mouths don't move during cutscenes. The co-op is half baked at best.  I'm surprised at just how often Stormgate is falling flat on it's face when not only did these developers work on successful projects, they can just copy what they did before.  You've done this already!  You should know what to do! It seems they've also forgotten one factor that made WarCraft 3 and StarCraft 2 so successful.  The custom maps made by the community are wildly popular with a wide range of players.  Are the map tools available?  Of course not!  This should have been a huge focus on getting out.  Release the map tools to the community.  Allow them to patch up the holes in this abysmal product.  While you work out more trash campaign missions, the community could be keeping everything alive with custom games. This is what I imagine a F2P version of WC3 would be like in 2003.  Unfortunately for Frost Giant, it's no longer 2003.  It's 2024 and this game is insulting.  The graphics suck, the art style sucks, this game is behind on every metric I can think of.  I paid so you don't have too.  Avoid this product. On the plus side, that Collector's Edition I paid for might be worth some money one day.

2024-07-30,"Posted: July 30 Early Access Review I was following this game and had participated in 3 beta tests. I left a lot of feedback with screenshots, explanations, and comparisons. I think you see where I am going with the past tense. Art direction and implementation are horrendously bad. It's like Fortnite and Valorant had a kid, but genetics made its move and gave the poor kid 5 conditions at the same time. God knows I tried to do something. The first concept arts were cool, but when I launched the first beta build I literally couldn't believe it was working as intended. I tried to fix it with checkboxes and sliders, but no luck, it wasn't broken. I uploaded detailed posts on Discord, Reddit, and asked the devs personally. They told me It's intended and it won't change. Then I gave up.  Units are bad, buildings are bad, ground is bad, everything is bad. Red Alert 3 or Warcraft 3 are looking better, I swear. The terrain is comparable to Emperor: Battle for Dune (It's from 2001 and it's one of the first 3D RTS).  WC3 terrain is years ahead. I am not exaggerating, just look at any screenshot. Animations are beyond bad, they, are not synchronized at all. Units slide, moonwalk, etc. The gameplay is slow and stiff. Fights aren't impactful. Units' movement is not that bad, but worse than SC2. The main problem with gameplay is the total and all-consuming boredom. Nothing in this game is cool. Units are boring, mechanics are boring, macro is boring, creeping is boring. Multiplayer is actually good, it is kinda boring for me, but I have to admit it is much better than any other mode in this game. The campaign is a meme. People make fun of characters on Reddit. It is just embarrassing. Co-op is not complete, missions are dull, the game starts to stutter hard on the late stages. The sound design is terrible. Volume and quality are all over the place. Voice acting is fundamentally cringe. I couldn't bear it so I muted it. Music is ok. Monetization is terrible. The Multiplayer is F2P, no P2W, everything is fair, no questions. Single-player and co-op are P2P ONLY (no earnable content) with a free demo. The problem is that the prices are 2 times higher than SC2, but the quality is not. Every co-op commander is 10$, and a pack of 3 missions for the campaign is 10$. SC2 has ~75 missions in total and ~15 commanders that you can buy. If SG had a similar quantity of content it would cost ~400$. You will never know how much do you need to pay to get all the content. This is created to milk players indefinitely. Conclusion: Everything is dull, safe, generic and/or badly implemented. I had high hopes for this game, but I don't think it is possible to fix so many flaws.",0,STORMGATE

2024-08-01,"Posted: August 1 Early Access Review I can tolerate the nightmare inducing faces that represent a human's, a rehashed Warcraft III campaign (but instead of Arthas getting a cursed sword Amara gets a fidget spinner), and Celestials dominating the ladder. The straw that broke the camel's back: I a-moved my scout (Vanguard dog unit) to kill an Imp (Infernal worker) and instead of attacking, it just floated while trying to bite a fleeing unit. That and you literally have an ad for ""GearUp Booster"" in the game's description (as of writing). I feel like I've been scammed. No wonder the genre is dying.

2024-07-30,Posted: July 30 Early Access Review They should have released the game next year instead of pushing this unpolished skeleton of a game now. Early Access will do more harm. Next gen RTS my a*s.,0,STORMGATE
2024-07-30,"Posted: July 30 Early Access Review The game makes no sense at all. The slogan ""next gen RTS"" is an absolute lie. But even ignoring that slogan and just looking at the game itself, there is nothing in it that even comes close to the level of Starcraft 2, Warcraft 3, or Age of Empires 4 (though admittedly, the game has little in common with AoE4 and is more of a mix of 80% Starcraft 2 and 20% Warcraft 3). But that's the main problem: in no aspect does the game outperform any of these titles; it lags behind by 5-10 years. Graphics - worse than in Starcraft 2, AoE4, and Warcraft 3 Reforged (if we consider the quality and detail of the units). Sound - worse. Music - worlds apart. Campaign - 6 missions? The Nova campaign in Starcraft is far more polished. Achievements - none. Originality - the human race is just a cheap attempt to copy the Terrans from Starcraft. At least when Starcraft took the Space Marines from Warhammer and the idea from Starship Troopers, they did it brilliantly. The second race is somewhat better but still feels like a mishmash of Starcraft's Zerg and Warcraft's Undead. The third race looks interesting, but the graphics kill the concept. Gameplay - why wouldn't I just play Starcraft 2, Warcraft 3, or AoE4? Co-op - again, Starcraft comes to mind. What's the point of buying characters? How did you plan to fund the game? In Starcraft, people eagerly awaited playing as Tychus or Mengsk because they had well-developed backstories. What's even one small advantage over Starcraft here? Overall, the main question is: why release a game that has no advantages whatsoever over the giants of the genre? It would have been better to polish the game for another two years. The game is so bad that when you press ""A"" and the left mouse button, 1 out of 5 times it doesn't register as an attack move, just a wasted click.",0,STORMGATE

2024-06-23,"Posted: June 23 Delightful pattern-solving logic puzzler with heart and humour * My VERY BEST recommendation * What it isn't : another 'Unpacking' (no, it really is NOT), a 'cat game', a decorating/tidying-and-arranging-things-as-you-like-it game. What it is : an observational, pattern-recognition puzzler, with easy-to-medium difficulty, GREAT artwork, lovely&soothing soundtrack, a charming-but-disruptive cat that pops by from time to time (Rookie!! yes, you can pet him, sometimes...), a great deal of personality, a warm sense of humour and a distinctive 'internal puzzle logic'. Yes, I know the store blurb says 'tidying', but this is a sorting-by-rules game, and NOT a game for expression of personal preferences or your personal logic of how-I-would-do-this-in-real-life. If that's what you're expecting, you will likely be frustrated and disappointed. For many puzzles the main challenge is to figure out what the goal of the puzzle IS, rather than managing to do it after you've figured out the goal. So if you need your puzzle games to 'tell you what it wants done', then this may not be a good fit for you. A GOOD GAME FOR: Great game for all kinds of people, and all ages. Casual and warm-hearted. Works fine on even simple gear. Easy to dip in and out of, for shorter or longer stretches. Will work best for people who have an eye for detail, and patience and logical mind to figure out the goal or pattern of the particular puzzles. Many of the puzzles in the game are easy, but some aren't. Note that this is NOT a game with a smooth ramp-up, the very easy and the more complex are scattered throughout. (There is a Skip, so you can always get back to a stuck one later on). GAME FORUM: By now a very enthusiastic fan base has made Guides for, well... everything :-). The forum Discussions is a friendly place, and easy to get helpful advice. Also - if you're stuck anywhere - USE the Guides, and the Search function in Discussions. Most likely whatever you're facing is not a bug, and almost certain to have been discussed/explained already. DEVS: Super helpful and attentive devs - any bugs or glitches sorted out quickly, always helpful with advice, and updates and new content still oncoming. Bug report thread on the Steam game forum, so no tedious redirecting to a Discord if you need help. If you've read early reviews you may have seen comments about some problems, mostly to do with achievements. These bugs have all been sorted out in later fixes. DAILY TIDY: As part of the main game you also get your very own Daily Tidy puzzle of the day. Every player gets a different one, but within a common theme for that day (currently 15 different categories). Easy-to-medium, with many puzzle types being quite easy, and some more complex. Meant to be solved in 1/2 minute to 5 minutes kind of thing - a little bit of sunshine in your day :-). They drop at midnight, as the date changes in your timezone, so you have only 24 hrs to solve each one. DLCs: In addition to main game, also 2 pay-for DLCs, out in June 2023 and in June 2024. Possibly more to come later (?) ... at least that's what the game's fans hope for! SETTINGS etc: All that you would expect - sounds, graphics, toggles to show stuff, vibrate on/off, tap-to-hold, cursor assist, etc. Reset/replay, skip, level select, in-game Hint . You can reset levels in settings to collect missing achievements, without losing ones already gained (like the No Hint and Use Hint ach's). Can be played with controller, Steam deck, kb/m, touchscreen. Non-gated progression - all levels available from start. (Thank you!) A very few levels (and one achievement) requires a bit of speed, but very doable even for this old lady with gnarly hands and slow reflexes on simple gear. Plus an ARCHIVE of 'Seasonal Special Daily puzzles' so they can be played/replayed in your own time. ACHIEVEMENTS: Many are tied to chapters and levels solved, some to odd things you have to find for yourself.  And a handful are tied to the Daily Tidy puzzles. NOTE for Completionists : Some achievements are tied to number of Daily Tidy puzzles - the biggest of these is the '100 total' (non-consecutive), and the '30 days consecutive'. Some people say they find the 30-day streak stressful because of the 24-hr window for each puzzle, so be aware of this issue if you're an avid achievement completionist. Also, it's a REALLY good idea to play the whole game through FIRST, before attempting the Daily streak, as all the Daily puzzle types are in the main game and best approached after understanding the 'internal  logic' of the game's puzzles. Also note that the DLCs have ach's, and that Steam achievements work so that they can't count separately to the main game ach's. So if you don't go for the DLCs, then your completion rate will fall when new DLCs are added. (It's a Steam thing, not a dev thing!) Specific QoL: - Colour issues: NOT a good game for people with colour blindness. Many of the puzzle solutions depend on colour differentiation, and often between colour shades that are very similar. - Hearing: Works fine for people with hearing issues, no puzzles depend on sound (although the soundtrack is very lovely) - Neurodivergence issues : Some players with selfdescribed neurovariation, OCD, etc., have praised the game as very soothing and satisfying. While others have reported being unhappy with things like Rookie the cat disrupting a solve (yes, he does that sometimes!), or having to follow the puzzle's internal logic instead of their own, or the stressor of the 24-hr window for the Daily Tidy puzzles. If you're unsure if the game will be a good fit for you, then I advise reading through pos. and neg. reviews before buying. (And keep in mind the 2-hr-in-the-game limit for Steam refunds). Arachnophobia warning : One of the puzzles in the main game features a spider, and which appears suddenly. It's quite cute, but may be too much for people with spider issues. One of the Daily Tidy puzzle categories is also this type of puzzle, but a workaround mod. has been made available by a kind player, so the spider can now be avoided in the Daily Tidies. (Devs have been busy with other things first, but have the issue on their radar and maybe an un-spider QoL mode may be forthcoming...) Yes, I'm a HUGE fan - I guess it shows  :-D",1,A LITTLE TO THE LEFT

2018-05-27,"Posted: May 27, 2018 Early Access Review Just ""finished"" the game. The Good As with most survival games, the early game is where much of the excitement lies, while discovering everything for the first time. The Shark.  Love it/hate it.  It's a great mechanic to keep the pressure on.  Although the pressure lessens greatly as you move towards ""end game"" (more on this later).   Some people in the forums have complained that the shark is to trope-y and furthers a ""harmful"" stereotype about sharks.  I can see this easily being remedied with other nemesis creatures stopping by (giant squid anyone?). Building the raft is fun.  It sort of reminds me of the old school Minecraft skyblock variant. The not so good Inventory management is a chore. Getting to the ""end game"" is gratifying, but after that the both the reason for continuing on and the replay value tanks.  I'm assuming the devs are planning for content beyond the current end-game stage to remedy this. The shark returns too quickly after death.  I think it should also be more difficult to kill the shark so the reward (a longer break from shark harrassment) should increase with the risk. It bothered me that I couldn't build on islands.  It also bothered me that I couldn't create a ""skiff"" (second raft) for excursions.  Everything in this game must be attached to the starting raft. It's odd that all the sea life, except the shark and the odd clam, is not visible in the water.  I'm catching fish left and right; never see one in the water...? There are some game mechanic/balance issue that, once discovered, make the game trivially easy.  These need to be addressed. [The conclusion] Solid early access game.  Has a lot of potential and room to grow.  Hope the devs keep moving along that path.",1,RAFT

2020-10-06,"Posted: October 6, 2020 Early Access Review Would I reccommend this game?  Yeah, you know, I would:  If you can play it with a person.  And maybe on easy.  Definitely on easy on your own. Listen, listen, I know.  You're a proud gamer, you don't play crap on easy.  I get it.  My save game is called ""easy mode offends me"".  And yet, there it is, that's what I did. Basically, there's not a lot of dangerous foes for the most part, not until much, much later in the game anyway.  I mean, there's a shark, yeah, so you stay on the raft and stab him in his sharky face when he tries to nibble on your raft.  (And then lure him into shallow water, throw bait and repeatedly poke him with sharp sticks until he expires from deathpoke.) So, really, the challenge is mostly in managing your hunger and thirst.  On normal, especially early in the game, it feels like all you're doing is boiling little thimblesful of water and cooking the tiniest sardines while your character is on the cusp of dying from gothic faminethirst.  It's kinda tedious, frankly.  So on easy, that gets turned down.  The shark will still shark you as hard as ever, the sardines are just as tiny and the thimbles of water still fail to slake your thirst, but the thirst and hunger meters deplete less quickly so you actually have time to go do other things. It's a pretty good coop implementation.  My bestest gaming buddy (who is also my wife and reads these things--hello!) and I sort of appreciate the slow wafting across the ocean, scavenging flotsam, building up a bigger raft and inventing sharper pokesticks to fend off things.  Playing this with somebody is nice because the game is stupendously lonely otherwise. It's just you, the ocean, tiny atolls and occasionally the detritus of somebody who was there years ago and is no longer. Rventually, when you have enough technology and you're not purely at the whims of the ocean, a plot starts to reveal itself, with places to explore.  We love exploring. So in the end, or if you were looking for one of those fashionable TL;DRs, this is a slow-paced game but can be kind of relaxing for the most part, appreciating the ocean, fishing up the tiniest sardines, and slowly wafting to the next adventure.",1,RAFT
2021-08-17,"Posted: August 17, 2021 Early Access Review The gameplay is beautiful, creative, and I enjoyed it. But now after 3 years on that raft, I'm a bit tired. I am 53 years old, can you finish this game before I die.",1,RAFT
2020-06-28,"Posted: June 28, 2020 Raft is a relaxing, occasionally zen-like experience as you bob on the open ocean, collecting resources, crafting goodies, both practical and cosmetic, and expanding from a single tiny raft into a massive higgledy piggledy self sustaining ship, occasionally stabbing a shark in the face with a spear (he deserved it) or getting rocks thrown at you by a bird (you deserved it). The survival elements are fairly simple and I find them well-tuned, and islands have become more and more exciting to explore as the game development has progressed. There's even a storyline now which is pretty cool the first time you experience it. There's an excellent balance between the peaceful sea-faring and island exploring and occasionally battling. With the most recent story based updates the game has really expanded, although it's still unfinished and development seems very slow. Bring a ""friend"" as shark bait The biggest benefit of Raft to me is the seamless co-op. Hosted on a local machine, your friends can drop in or out of your game effortlessly and help you. If you should want to let them progress without you, which I have done a few times, you can easily send them the file to load. It's not quite as good as it being persistently online, but it's easy enough. I played around 40 hours with my husband and a friend and we pulled together, assigning jobs and positions, working as a team to explore the ocean and the land, baiting the shark away from the others, tucking unconscious bodies into bed, you know, all the sorts of things friends do for each other. Chest Wars However, I will warn you that your friendships will be sorely tested when it comes to storage. I cannot tell you how frustrating it was to sort every chest into specific categories, painstakingly labelled with signs, and then find that my husband had dropped wood into my seed box, or scuba gear into my food box. In the end I told him not to touch any of the boxes except the one with his name on it. It staved off divorce. I also got yelled at a few times for re-arranging the rooms, but really, these guys have no interior design skills! Look I'm type A okay, I need order on my boat, even in the apocalypse. What's bad? The main drawback is that the development is slower than me running a marathon with ankle weights on. It's getting there, but no one knows when it'll pass the finish line and you're just hoping it doesn't have a heart attack en route. I'm patiently waiting, but I do wish the full experience was ready. It's come a long way from release, but I can't help but feel there's still a ways to go. Despite the snail-like development, I've really enjoyed my time spent on the game and eagerly look forward to coming back to it next patch, so it gets a thumbs up from me. 💖 If you find the reviews of an old Welsh lady interesting, please follow My Curator Page . 💖 Updating because I just nominated this for the Steam Awards ""Labor of Love"" award, and also I'm cheeky and want the badge for editing a review.

Victory points are very fast No profiles page to see stats or match history present. No ability to view leaderboards in-game. No ranked matchmaking in multiplayer. Fallschirmjagers missing 3D models. Missing surrender option. No inventory system - you cannot change the badge, banner, title, basically anything related to your ingame profile personalization. Only 3 Battlegroups per faction (same amount as in beta). As a result, there are units currently in the game that are unable to be accessed in multiplayer due to there not being a battlegroup made for them. Only 2 4v4 MP maps (same amount as in beta). Only 3 3v3 MP maps (same amount as in beta). No earning of credits after games, meaning no way for us to earn said free credits to later buy things in the in-game store like in COH2. Untitled Italian unit with Adrian helmet seen in Relic's official COH3 screenshots is nowhere to be seen in the game. Unable to queue capture orders on the tactical map. No way to view the map at the end of the game. No chat room server support. After the game ends, there is no way to chat with your opponents or teammates. No ability to name your multiplayer game. No background sounds of birds chirping, faded gunfire in the distance, etc that was present in previous entries to give off that 'COH vibe'. No player names showing over units when hovered over them. No player list in-game in multiplayer (can't tell if human teammate got replaced by AI) No leaderboards for pre-made teams. No crushing infantry with heavy vehicles. Not being able to ram tanks into buildings to create holes anymore (building destruction physics). Unit statistics not viewable in game, nor what their advantages are. Not being able to rebind modifier keys like Shift, Alt, and Tab. For example, this makes this a no-buy for some who are left-handed and don’t use a traditional hand placement on a keyboard. No scroll speed setting (edge panning speed) for those who don't use WASD or arrows as default. Cannot multi-select control groups with Shift + Numbers, instead it assigns multiple control groups to individual units. No ability to click on a dropped lmg or anti tank weapon to see exactly what kind of weapon it is. 'Temporary' main menu UI from beta still remaining in full release. Tiny soundtrack compared to previous COH games. No ability to have the camera follow a unit you double clicked on (either the unit or it portrait). This was present in COH1/2. No Bulletin system. No Observer mode. Unable to see crew weapons built in post-match stats screen. No replays (although a workaround is available). Unable to invite friends from Steam, directly from the steam UI and steam overlay. Disappointing state of modding tools. Many possibilities were promised by Relic pre-launch in terms of modding, but it seems that turned out to be false and in reality the options are very limited. Only English language voice tracks. Bugs: Devil's Brigade DLC not unlocking for the launch edition of the game for everyone. Global Unit Control Position keeps resetting itself after each game. AI failing to attack you in campaign unless scripted. Custom game server browser broken. For example, you can only see 9 games, no sorting, no searching, no paging of the list. The top 9 games are usually never launched with an AFK host. Instances where crew served weapons (for example, a US MG Squad and a mortar squad) both got ""stuck"" in a green covered position (which they were not really stuck or surrounded since it was open behind them) after pressing retreat. 254 Recon Tractor has the ability to call in free offmap mortars, at vet 1 it gains the ability to lock and have an improved barrage overwriting the default one. US Airborne troops infinite spawn glitch. Capture point bug. For example, the enemy did not loose tickets. We had 400, they had 39. We still held one, but we tickled down until we lost. Pings have several seconds of sound delay. Base building flashing between textures when anti-aliasing is set to high. Some portraits or icons may appear lower resolution or not scaling correctly to the user interface. Infantry units having their 'engines be broken'. Flickering walls bug. Sound and graphics begin to stutter after certain amount of playtime. Restarting the game fixes. Airborne models reload their carbines like they are a bolt action. Some team weapons have their animation speed ramped up way too fast. Example, the Brit heavy mortar. The Behind Enemy Lines ability for the US Airborne does not function as intended. When capturing a team weapon, your units adopt previous owner/faction voice lines. One of the US At gun voice lines is completely bugged, the voice sounds like a squeaky robot. Howitzers do not angle their guns correctly when firing. They do not match the angle of the shells leaving the cannon. Some units get stuck when exiting a building depending on surrounding geometry. Sometimes abilities will overlap existing abilities instead of moving to an empty square in the HUD. This often occurs when upgrading units or unlocking new Veterancy abilities. Not being able to click on top of the big notifications. Unable to save skirmish settings. Icons don’t show when an ability is in use. The only shown the cooldown after the ability end. For example, when I order an mortar to barrage a target out of its range i can’t tell if walked up to the fitting range and started barraging from its icon. Sometimes cast ability’s are ignored. For example, like when a tank isn’t in range and I cast a Panzerschrank the grenadiers just ignore the order and keep walking somewhere else. Unit icons inside buildings being off screen unless you can see the whole building, causing you to get suppressed without knowing from where its coming. No autosave in campaign. After match stats are hilariously broken and inaccurate. Minimap has no indicator of which specific unit is selected if you are tabbing through several. When using ""walking stuka"" is a circle, which doesn't fit the barrage itself which is instead an oval like shape. Ultra texture option is locked out for no reason (although a workaround is available). Pathfinding for vehicles is terrible. Friends who are online and in-game don’t show up as online or inviteable many times. Reticle/marker: when you send/direct multiple units to a spot shows only arrow, not the dots+arrow representing each group in the selection. Things currently in COH3 needing improvement: In-game visuals look too washed out/bland, require better lightning/contrast. As such, soldiers also tend to blend with the ground, sometimes not being able to instantly see where the model is standing. Wonky, at times brain dead in-game AI. Pings are still barely noticeable. COH2 it was too loud and spammy, now it makes barely any sound and hard / impossible to find. Tank explosions need work. For example, an exploding tank will only become static and give off a tame explosion VFX, unlike in COH2 where it would physically shake, create larger more dynamic explosion, and you would see parts and bodies flying off. Poor sound mixing. Extremely muffled and needs revamp. When up - The kill counters are hard to find on units now. You’ve got to hover over the experience bar. Makes it hard for viewers to tell at a glance. Just makes no sense. - Missing audio cues for grenades being lobbed (specifically satchel charges) - Units getting stuck after exiting certain houses. - No ingame leaderboards - No proper social system ingame to chat with the rest of the community - No option to rejoin after disconnecting (it’s 2023 we should have this option now…) - No observer mode - No proper replay system - No depth to ingame tips and guides/ build orders - The tactical map is a mess with unit cards covering other unit cards - Machineguns in buildings missing their face direction button.

2023-04-18,"Posted: April 18, 2023 I defended this game for weeks after launch. It was rough, but many games have a rough launch these days. I told myself I was impressed by the frequent patches, and what seemed like an honest attempt to fix both balance problems and the plethora of bugs. That all changed for me when their first major update was adding the in-game currency and store. I pre-ordered the game (for $80), and with all of the horrific bugs that were still out, and the obvious balance issues, their priority was to try to get more money out of their player base. I can't defend this game anymore. Maybe we will get to a point where I feel like the game was worth the money, but we are ABSOLUTELY not there yet. I hope they eventually get their act together, but right now I couldn't be more disappointed. -- UPDATE (July, 2024) -- Ultimately, this game is in a much better place than it was at launch.

It's the fact that clearly those in charge are brain dead and completely tone deaf to their player base.  I can easily afford it.  I may end up caving in and paying the 16.  I also may never spend another dollar on a Relic game again.  Shocking.  why don't you do the right thing and include the new content for free to those who have already purchased the game as a way to say sorry for the complete and utter trash you that you released to us at full price?",0,COMPANY OF HEROES 3
2024-03-05,"Posted: March 5 Product received for free I only play for the campaign in games like these. I am not a PvP guy. With that said, I would love to say this game is amazing. Because it was, up until it wasn't. The main goal of the entire campaign is to take over Italy and make it all the way to Rome. Except the campaign was never completed by the devs. It seems they just ran out of time and picked some arbitrary point during the campaign to call that ""The End"". You never make it to Rome. They just threw in a cinematic that tells you what happened when you got close enough to Rome. ""Hey good job, we won. Don't worry about Rome after all. Why? I just can't recommend a game like that.",0,COMPANY OF HEROES 3
2023-05-14,"Posted: May 14, 2023 DO NOT BUY THIS GAME Totally unfinished game. As someone who played the very first alphas of this game i can assure you not a lot has changed since those tests. Things i like -Breaching is cool and more units should have it, its weird that a lot of troops with full auto or elite troops cant breach buildings -Tank riding is a gimmick but im happy its in -The 17pdr guns in game sound amazing -Destuction feels abit better than 2. More battlefield like -4 factions on release The Bad -The audio is bad, voices dont sound right, guns are soft, planes sound like they are in your room. MG42's dont sound like MG42's -Animations are bad and all over the place -Balance is just awful, the smallest patch can swing the meta all over nothing feels balanced at all (Right now UK and Dak are just worthless playing) -Graphics are cartoony -Tank combat looks bad compared to the other games, Armour feels like paper and penetrations look poor as do bounces -Unit icons are missing, they have just used placeholders from Coh2 instead of making new ones (who knew marders were actually su-85s?) -Units are clearly cut to be sold to us later on though the shop such as Australian / Canadian inf, 2pdrs, archers, pak88's and much more (all these were available in alpha and beta tests -Descriptions are wrong. ""Easy 8 comes with rifles"" Actually comes with engineers. ""Tank post Builds Churchill tanks, Archer tanks"" Archers arent in multiplayer and Churchill are Battle group. Theres plenty more examples -Next to no maps, theres like 3 for 1v1 2 for 3v3 and 3 for 4v4 -And a million more things wrong Things downright missing from Coh2 (a 10 year old game) -Replays -Ranked -Leaderboards -Icons -MG facing in buildings (Turns out you can if you click drag) -Tank Crushing -Audio and voicelines -Plenty more But dont worry they added a really scummy and overpriced skin shop well before the ability to see who belonged to what colour on the team list and patched people doing challenges in custom games before they patched a single game breaking bug.

2023-11-16,"Posted: November 16, 2023 UPDATE 2/18: I was able to get the remaining 8000 merit in the span of 34 hours of very casual gameplay, playing 2-3 times per week to complete all of the weekly missions and daily's to earn 1 of the 2 battlegroups available. I went with Rangers, which are fun, and give a bit spice to the game. That being said, the biggest issue during this grind is how stale the game is playing the same 4-6 maps because of being forced to play either multiplayer or coop vs AI missions. Not being able to play modded maps, or anything to change the game up is understandable to not completely cheese the missions, but definitely makes it less of an enjoyable grind. I am happy that I was able to get some of the content without paying, but it's a bit stale and by no means worth $60 or $76 with the DLC. Catch a sale for $30 or so and it's probably worth it. At the announcement of the new ""expansion pack"" I can officially say this game is a lost cause. After 8 months of small updates, with absolutely no new content (aside from maps) which was already lacking from the start, the removal of units from the alpha and beta tests, and now the new commanders being locked behind a $16 ""Expansion"" that only gives 1 commander for 2 of the 4 factions? It's a joke. I really wanted to love this game, I have plenty of hours in this, and all company of heroes games, but I have to hang up my hat when the company repeatedly decides to slap it's community in the face over and over. Mechanics wise this game is pretty great in all honesty, but it fails in almost every single other aspect. Their very own previous title had a ton of ways to play, while this one was locked down to 12 different commanders in total across all nations. (I will acknowledge that this game launched with more content than 2 at launch, but I think it's fair to compare a game to it's predecessor that it's replacing at time the new title dropping, not launch to launch) Also the commander's in the previous title were between .99$ to $2.99. I don't know if SEGA or Relic is to blame here, but it's honestly a shame.",0,COMPANY OF HEROES 3
